**A tabletop RPG is a game in which players discuss a fictional setting and assume the roles of characters within that setting.** The discussion may include acting, improvised storytelling, or a processes of structured decision-making. Most often, actions taken by characters within the game succeed or fail according to a formal system of rules and guidelines.

Play of an RPG typically works like this:
- A group of people gather for the purpose of playing a particular tabletop RPG.
- Players determine their roles and create characters as necessary, discussing it along the way.
	- Usually, one player takes the role of "GM"; the game master, guide, moderator, referee or storyteller. In *Dungeons & Dragons*, this role is called dungeon master.
	- The other players typically have one "player character" each.
- Everybody takes some time to get familiar with the rules necessary to start playing.
- The GM describes a situation that the player characters are involved in. She asks the players what they want to do.
- The players describe what the characters say or do in the fiction.  The GM listens: if no game rules apply to this situation, they describe how the situation changes, with an aim towards bringing the players into an exciting or dangerous situation. Otherwise, the GM interprets and applies the rules.
	- The GM will usually explain what rules are being applied, so that everything seems fair to the players.
- The game may switch to procedures for a different mode, like a contest between two characters, a battle, a chase scene, an investigation, or a debate. These are outlined in a game's rules.
- Players continue as long as they like. Usually this is 2-3 hours, stopping at any natural stopping point or the end of prepared material.

For a video game metaphor, think Zork, or other interactive fiction. You have a situation described with words and use words to explain what you want to do.

If you would like to know more about the origin of RPGs, it's covered in the [[History of Games]].

My notes use the term "TTRPG" to distinguish this kind of game from role-playing video games. This doesn't mean a TTRPG must take place around a table, though--they can be played in a voice call, on a virtual canvas, in a text based forum, or a number of other mediums. **The key element is discussion**, not the physical parts.
## Why would you play one of these when video games exist?

Well, they're something different, and that can be enough. But I think it's important to realize that a tabletop RPG creates quite a different experience than a video game, even if the game is a *Baldur's Gate* or *Solasta: Crown of the Magister* that aims to implement the rules text of a particular tabletop game as closely as it can.

- Because the text and the play of tabletop RPGs are built out of language, and interpreted in whatever way the people at the table agree to, there are way more possibilities for **creative play**. Even in the crunchiest combat-focused games, players will be improvising actions, combining powers in novel ways, or interpreting the consequences of the fight beyond simple scorekeeping.
- In a video game, you're following a path written by someone else. In a tabletop game, you can **tell the story as you want it**, really inhabit the character you're playing, and leave your own mark on the world.
- Tabletop RPGs **aren't code, they're ideas**. You can tweak the game you're playing to match what you want it to do without being a professional artist or software engineer. They're run by a group of living, breathing human beings, so it's relatively easy to fix problems and oversights in your games yourself.
- RPGs have a **thriving independent scene** these days thanks to Internet communities, digital publishing, print-on-demand services, and the ease of tweaking and remixing ideas from other games.
- Tabletop games are often **easier to learn** and understand than video games, especially to people who aren't frequent gamers. You never have to figure out a confusing user interface or figure out the sequence of buttons that lets you do what you want. You don't need to worry about reflexes or hand-eye coordination. A capable GM can allow players of all abilities to have a fun time together.
- RPGs are **cooperative, social, and collaborative** by nature. They're a structured way to have conversations with friends. Role-playing is a lot of fun, even when you're doing it badly.
- If you're playing at a table, it's great to see people face-to-face. You can take a break from the screens that occupy so much else of your life. There's also something really pleasant about rolling dice, flipping through books, jotting down notes, marking things on character sheets, and making maps.
