## 1. Writing makes you smarter.
- Use full sentences in your own words on anything more than a \#fleeting note.

## 2. Keep the system simple.
- Use folders *only* for fictional contexts that you'll want to exclude from the main pages.
	- and for interacting with plugins.
- Prefer links to tags when you're making associations for a human person to read.

## 3. Writing takes circuits, not lines.
- Don't worry about making things beautiful, just express them in a way that's comfortable.
- You can revisit ideas later.
- Add bibliographical information on literature notes.

## 4. Ride the wave.
- When you have momentum on some idea, keep pursuing it.

## 5. Have fun!
- If using this becomes a pain in the neck for more than two days in a row then there is probably something wrong.
