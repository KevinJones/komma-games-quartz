(oneliner:: Defend cities from ballistic missiles.)

Developer:: Atari
Publisher:: Atari
Release Date:: 1980-07
Hours:: 0.1

A shooting game where you must defend six cities from ballistic missiles by shooting them down in mid-air. Your anti-missile batteries have an interesting limitation: it takes significant time for their shots to reach incoming missiles, so you need to anticipate where they will intersect and lead your target. The fire of an explosion lingers for a time, which can lead to some really satisfying chain reactions.
