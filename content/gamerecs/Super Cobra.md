(oneliner:: An early shmup.)

Developer:: Konami
Publisher:: Konami, Stern
Release Date:: 1981-03-01
Hours:: 0.1

A horizontally scrolling shooter where you control a helicopter raiding a base defended by missiles, anti-air guns, and rocky terrain. Your ultimate goal is to retrieve the BOOTY at the end of the 10th stage. Besides blowing up as much stuff as you can, you must also avoid crashing into hills and hit enough fuel containers to keep your chopper's engines running. A pleasant predecessor to Konami's later shmup efforts.
