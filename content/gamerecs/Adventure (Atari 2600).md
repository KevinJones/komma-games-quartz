(oneliner:: A square hero searches for a magical chalice.)

Developer:: Warren  Robinett
Publisher:: Atari
Release Date:: 1980-01-01
Hours:: 0.1

A primitive adventure game, where you control a square hero who explores an open landscape to find the tools and treasures that will lead them to a magical chalice, which they must return to the golden castle. Despite its vintage, it's actually got a couple ideas that feel unusual compared to other games, such as the portable bridge, or the item-stealing bats. Plan ahead so you don't get soft locked!
