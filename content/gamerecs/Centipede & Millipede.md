*Centipede* is a fixed-screen shooter controlled with a trackball, where you control a tiny ship that's defending a forest from invading bugs, spiders, and unwanted mushrooms. *Millipede* is its sequel, with some tweaks to enemy behavior and a bit more variety. They're simple, frantic, and challenging with a fun theme and a unique pastel look--plus this kind of analog control is rare among arcade shooters.
