(oneliner:: A groovy little shooting game.)

Developer:: Steve Cartwright
Publisher:: Activision
Release Date:: 1982-01-01
Hours:: 0.1

A fixed shooter where you must shoot down every enemy ship within a time limit. The designs for the enemy ships err on the side of the absurd, with craft that look like cheeseburgres, cookies, steam irons, bow ties, and so forth. The time pressure and lighthearted mood make it worth checking out if you're an Atari 2600 fan.
