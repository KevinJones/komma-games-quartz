(oneliner:: Shoot bad guys with arrows and collect treasure.)

Developer:: Exidy 
Publisher:: Exidy
Release Date:: 1981-01-01
Hours:: 0.1

An action game of dungeon exploration. You control a smiley face who must enter rooms, shoot arrows at baddies, and collect treasures. You have more freedom of movement in this game than in contemporary maze games, and its method of zooming in and out of individual dungeon rooms gives the action a snappy pace.
