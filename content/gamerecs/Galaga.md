(oneliner:: Shoot down alien formations.)

Developer:: Namco
Publisher:: Namco, Midway
Release Date:: 1981-09-01
Hours:: 0.1

A fixed-screen shmup about shooting arrays of aliens in outer space, which fly onto the screen in formation until the whole fleet has arrived, then attack the player with coordinated dives. Where the old *Space Invaders* can feel predictable to a modern player, *Galaga* is more dynamic, rewarding quick reflexes and understanding alien movement to lead your shots appropriately.
