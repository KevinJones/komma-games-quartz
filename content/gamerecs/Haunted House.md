(oneliner:: Describe this game.)

Developer:: James Andreasen
Publisher:: Atari
Release Date:: 1981-01-01
Hours:: 0.1

A crude but surprisingly playable piece of horror. In this maze game, you control a pair of eyes in a dark mansion, trying to collect pieces of an urn and leave the building alive. Starting with Game 2 (which introduces the match-lighting mechanic) it's surprisingly creepy for how minimal it is.
