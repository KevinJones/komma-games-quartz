(oneliner:: Wizards blast enemies in a maze.)

Developer:: Dave Nutting Associates
Publisher:: Midway
Release Date:: 1980-01-01
Hours:: 0.1

A maze shooting game for one or two players. You move and you shoot at enemies to aim for a high score. It's most interesting for allowing cooperative or competitive play within a single mode. Plus that voice synthesis is killer.
