(oneliner:: Use your ziplines to climb a prehistoric mountain.)

Developer:: Konami
Publisher:: Konami
Release Date:: 1983-01-01
Hours:: 0.1

In this game you play an archaeologist who has to climb a mountain populated by dinosaurs and hairy cavemen in order to retrieve a phoenix egg. You have a flashlight and a harpoon gun in order to do this. There's nothing too special or singularly important about this game aside from the involvement of Tokuro Fujiwara, who would go on to create *Bionic Commando*. I just happen to think it's not half bad.

TODO: I should actually replay this and see if I still think it holds up.
