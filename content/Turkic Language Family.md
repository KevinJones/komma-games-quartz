- language family spoken by Turkic peoples of Eurasia, from Eastern Europe to Southern Europe to Central Asia, East Asia, Siberia, and Western Asia
- originated in a region spanning from Mongolia to Northwest China
- includes Turkish, Uzbek, Azerbaijani, Uyghur, and many more
- some linguists have suggested a genetic relation between Turkic and Korean, but the idea of grouping the Turkic, Mongolic, and Tungusic language families, possibly with Japonic and Koreanic, is not a mainstream linguistic view.
