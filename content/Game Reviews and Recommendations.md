This list of game recommendations started in about 2018. It's an attempt to make sense out of game history, to hold on to those things I consider valuable, to understand them on a deeper level than just "fun retro nostalgia that reminds you of being a kid in the 1990s." (Not particularly helpful if you weren't a typical kid in the 1990s, after all.) As I continued to develop the list, I found its format was useful for more contemporary games, too. If you want to understand my taste in games, see what's out there, or just find a new old favorite, this is the place to be.

## About

So here are the rules you need to know:
- This is a tour through classic video games from all eras of the industry, split into chunks that are about a decade long. To limit the scope, each chunk is limited to about 1,000 hours in length, based on the time you'd need to invest to experience what the game has to offer. This means the list tends to put a bigger emphasis on short, excellent games when it can, rather than games that meander or are stuffed with filler content.
	- "Time to complete" is an approximation taken from the "Main+Extra" time reported by the users of [HowLongToBeat](https://howlongtobeat.com/).
	- If you spend 10 hours a week playing video games, then 1,000 hours would take you about two years to finish.
	- Role-playing games are separated from the rest of the chunk because they are usually longer but you can play them more passively. See [what this list considers an RPG](GR%20-%20What%20is%20an%20RPG%20Video%20Game.md)
- I focus on games that are still fun or exciting if you play them today. I don't mean that you can start up *Faxanadu* and get something as thrilling as *Elden Ring*, but that if you approach the game on its own terms you can have a fun time with it. I also focus on the experience of playing the game on today's technology, in a modern source port or emulator. Games that have some interesting aspects but aren't quite as easy to pick up and enjoy are listed in a separate table.
	- For example, *Lemmings* plays much better in *NeoLemmix*, which adds features such as an undo button to the puzzler.
	- You should always play according to your own preferences, but I recommend that you use save states/rewind sparingly on games you play for their challenge, and fast-forward through the repetitive parts of RPGs.
- **Play today.** Whenever possible, I've included links with the most convenient ways to play the game today, short of tracking down the original media or searching abandonware archives. In some cases, emulation will give you a better experience than the official re-release. I still encourage you to support re-releases (within reason) to let companies know that people really do care about older games that can stand the test of time.
- **Exclusion criteria.** Text adventures and most visual novels are outside the scope of this site. Games that are no longer playable in any form are excluded. Game must be playable reasonably well on a "standard controller", meaning a dual analog gamepad, a mouse and keyboard combo, or a keyboard and simple flight stick combo. No "collectible" games focused on buying real-world plastic toys or digital trading cards. No games designed for real-world gambling. No games designed primarily for erotic appeal. (See [[Thoughts on Eroge|note]].) Any games that use buyable loot boxes, gacha, daily quests, or related monetization methods will include a warning--I generally won't recommend them unless there's something of real value within them.

What this list considers "current hardware":
- PCs running Windows 10 or newer ("win")
- PlayStation 4 or PlayStation 5 ("ps4")
- Xbox One or Xbox Series X/S ("xb1")
- Nintendo Switch
- games that run within a web browser

It doesn't consider streaming services like PlayStation Now and generally can't keep up with game releases on mobile platforms like Android and iOS.
