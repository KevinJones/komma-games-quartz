1996 paper by Richard Bartle focused on MMO players

quadrant model: x axis is interacting with world vs interacting with players, y axis is acting on things unilaterally vs interacting with things

- Achievers/Diamonds want to gain concrete measure of success: points, levels, equipment
- Explorers/Spades want to travel around, solve puzzles, find secrets, immerse themselves in the game world
- Socializers/Hearts want to socialize with other players
- Killers/Clubs want to get high scores, cause mayhem, best other players in friendly (or unfriendly) competition

sort of a typology; a single player can fit into multiple categories to varying degrees

good starting point, still frequently referenced, but focus on one type of game makes it quite incomplete

other big problem: Explorer type didn't appear in later research, and suggested sub-factors of Explorer type (geographical exploration and analyzing game mechanics) were not correlated
