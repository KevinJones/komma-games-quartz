Notes here based on Peace Corps China Lesson 3.
## Pointing to something and naming it.

**是 shì is "to be".** It is normally followed by a noun which defines the topic or subject. It is not normally followed by an adjective on its own.

|          |              |               |
| -------- | ------------ | ------------- |
| 这是茶。 | Zhè shì chá. | This is tea.  |
| 那是饭。 | Nà shì fàn.  | That is rice. |

## Asking a yes-no question about something.

**Add the question particle 吗 ma** to the end of the sentence that would otherwise be a plain statement.

|            |                 |               |
| ---------- | --------------- | ------------- |
| 这是茶吗？ | Zhè shì chá ma? | Is this tea?  |
| 那是饭吗？ | Nà shì fàn ma?  | Is that rice? |

To respond, **use 是 shì or 不是 bú shì.**  不 bù is a negative word. It can mean "no" on its own, or it can negate the verb or adjective it precedes. *(When it comes before a fourth tone, its tone changes to the second. Why?)*

|      |         |              |
| ------ | ------- | ------------ |
| 是。   | Shì.    | Yes (it is).             |
| 不是。 | Bú shì. | No (it isn't). |

## Asking what something is.

**Use 什么 shénme, "what".**  Like all Chinese interrogative pronouns, it goes in the position of the sentence where the answers would be expected.

|                |                 |               |
| -------------- | --------------- | ------------- |
| 这是**什么**？ | Zhè shí shénme? | What is this? |
| 这是茶。       | Zhè shì chá.    | This is tea.  | 
| 那是**什么**？ | Nà shì shénme?  | What is that? |
| 那是饭。       | Nà shì fàn.     | That is rice. |
