How do you categorize tabletop role playing games? There's no strictly scientific way of doing it, but you could try asking the following questions...

**What genre of fiction is it?** Many popular RPGs are in the fantasy genre, set in a fictional world with spells, magical creatures, cursed jewel, and epic adventures. Other games are based on sci-fi, horror, or historical scenarios.

- Fantasy (*Dungeons and Dragons*, *Blades in the Dark*, *Pathfinder*)
- Science Fiction (*Cyberpunk RED*, *Scum and Villainy*, *Mutant: Year Zero*)
- Horror (*Call of Cthulhu*, *Alien: The Roleplaying Game*, *Delta Green*)
- Military / Espionage (*Twilight: 2000*, *FIST: Ultra Edition*, *Never Going Home*)
- History (*Pendragon*, *Night Witches*)
- General-Purpose (*Fate*, *GURPS*, *Savage Worlds*)

**How does it treat its rules?** Classic RPGs have well-defined rules about dice rolls, characters sheet, structure of play, conflict resolution, and so on. Other games called "Storytelling RPGs" focus on procedures that let the group of players develop a story together. Finally, rules-lite RPGs use simpler rules for pick-up-and-play fun with minimal prep.

- Classic Rules Style (*Lancer*, *Cyberpunk RED*, *Dungeons and Dragons*)
- Storytelling Rules (*Wanderhome*, *The Quiet Year*, *Monster of the Week*)
- Rules-lite (*Fiasco*, *Dread*, *Honey Heist*)

> The game's text will tell you how *it* treats its rules, but your experience at the table depends much more on how the GM and players treat the rules.

**What is the style of play?** D&D is designed for campaign play; a long-term style of play where characters develop over time and the narrative gets more complex. Some games are designed primarily for one-shot play, where players can complete a self-contained adventure in a single session.

Furthermore, RPGs are typically cooperative, with players working as a team to overcome obstacles, but there are occasionally ones where players compete against each other, or where players collaborate tell a story about characters opposed to each other.

- Campaign Play (*Dungeons and Dragons*, *FATE*, *Pathfinder*)
- One-shot Play (*Lasers & Feelings*, *Fiasco*, *Masks: A New Generation*)
- Competitive Play (*Paranoia*, *Houses of the Blooded*)
