In principle, I have a progressive attitude towards "eroge"; games designed mainly for erotic appeal or those that include explicit sexual content within a bigger story. I think this category of game should exist! I think we should be talking about ways to make them more humanizing, less creepy, and appropriately separated from underage players.

In practice, I am *definitely* not the kind of person eager to explore or write about the topic in a "reader's guide" kind of way. I would not be comfortable as a writer, and I don't think it would be very valuable to readers due to how much your experience with one of these games will vary depending on your own identity and sexual preferences. That's something small and personal, not something to learn from a big guide written for a general audience.
