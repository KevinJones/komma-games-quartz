(oneliner:: A clown in a castle sends unicorn monsters plummeting to their demise.)

Developer:: Universal
Publisher:: Universal
Release Date:: 1983-01-01
Hours:: 0.1

Also known as *Mr. Do vs Unicorns*. This puzzly platform game sees [[Mr. Do!]] the clown trapping unicorns by knocking out floors with his mallet. (For shame, how could he?) As a player, your goal is to help Mr. Do extract the three keys from the blocks on each screen and escape through the door at the top. As with most of the vintage games I recommend, it's simple, unique, and immanently playable.

And yes, I suspect it was somewhat influenced by [[Heiankyo Alien]].
