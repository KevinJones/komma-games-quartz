*Chuckie Egg* is a fun little platform game in the [[Donkey Kong]] tradition, where you play as a farmer who must collect chicken eggs while avoiding the ducks. There's two different versions: one with realistic physics (represented here by the BBC Micro) and one with a more arcadey feel (such as you find on the ZX Spectrum).
