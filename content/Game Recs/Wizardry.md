Hours:: 1

The grandmother of dungeon crawler video games. Create a party and venture into a 10-floor dungeon, engaging in tactical turn-based combat. Go in, fight stuff, try to map out a little more, then go back to town to power up your characters. Quite tough but more playable than you would expect. JRPG combat traces much of its ideas back to Wizardry.

Designer Robert Woodhead considers the NES port the definitive version, while I'm quite a fan of its SNES port.
