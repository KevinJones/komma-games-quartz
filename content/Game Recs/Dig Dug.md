(oneliner:: Dig through soil and burst/crush your enemies.)

Developer:: Namco
Publisher:: Namco, Atari
Release Date:: 1982-04-19
Hours:: 0.1

A golden-age classic where you dig your own maze and try to eliminate all the enemies on-screen. (They are "Pookas" and "Fygars", if you want to be technical.) Simple and pleasant, plus the inspiration for numerous other "digging games."
