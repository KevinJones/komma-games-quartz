(oneliner:: An intense dystopian shooter.)

Developer:: Vid Kidz
Publisher:: Williams
Release Date:: 1982-01-01
Hours:: 0.1

A audio-visually intense twin-stick shooter, where you shoot a lot of robots and try to rescue the last surviving members of humanity (but a lot of them will die right in front of you). Not recommended for those with visual sensitivity concerns, but for other folks it's a wonderfully noisy, neon nightmare.
