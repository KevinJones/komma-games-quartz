(oneliner:: Knights battle in flight on large birds.)

Developer:: Williams
Publisher:: Williams
Release Date:: 1982-07-16
Hours:: 0.1

A knight with a lance, riding either an ostrich or a stork, flies around over a lava pit and battles fearsome foes riding buzzards. Yeah, it's pretty absurd but it's an absolutely unforgettable premise. It features an unusual control scheme where players must "flap" to ascend and strike foes from above.

If you have fun with Joust, some other games to check out are 1983's *Jetpac* and *Mario Bros.*, 1984's *Balloon Fight*, and the ten-player community battle *Killer Queen Black* (2019).
