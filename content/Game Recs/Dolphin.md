*Dolphin* is an obscure Atari 2600 game that puts your hearing to the test. You play as a dolphin and must keep swimming through a side-scrolling environment to avoid capture by a giant squid. Seahorses block your way, but you get an early warning of their formation based on the pitch of a sonar tone--a higher pitch means an opening towards the top of the screen, and a lower pitch means one towards the bottom. It's a unique theme and challenge; just a good ocean vibe for the Atari.
