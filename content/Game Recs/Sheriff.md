(oneliner:: A sheriff spins around and shoots outlaws.)

Developer:: Nintendo
Publisher:: Nintendo, Exidy
Release Date:: 1979-01-01
Hours:: 0.1

A solid, tactical "twin-stick" shooter, where you play as a Sheriff in a shootout with a gang of tiny outlaws. The original cabinet possessed a joystick and a rotary dial, but if you're playing this in MAME it plays well if you map the rotation to a gamepad's shoulder buttons.
