(oneliner:: Reassumble the burial urn and leave the dark mansion alive.)

Developer:: James Andreasen
Publisher:: Atari
Release Date:: 1981-01-01
Hours:: 0.1

A crude but surprisingly playable piece of horror. In this maze game, you control a pair of eyes in a dark mansion, trying to collect pieces of a magic urn and leave the building without being taken out by vampire bats, tarantulas, and other frightening creatures. Starting with Game 2 (which introduces the match-lighting mechanic) it's surprisingly creepy for how minimal it is.

> And now, a public service announcement. Tarantulas are harmless to humans, and not any more dangerous than a bumble bee. They will keep bugs like crickets and beetles in check. Some people even keep them as pets! Tarantulas deserve your respect!
