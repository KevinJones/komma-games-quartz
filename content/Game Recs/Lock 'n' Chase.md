(oneliner:: Get the dots, ditch the cops.)

Developer:: Data East
Publisher:: Data East, Taito
Release Date:: 1981-06-19
Hours:: 0.1

A maze game where you play a blobby robber collecting dots while avoiding the cops. Unlike [Pac-Man](gamerecs/Pac-Man.md), there is no power-up to let you turn the tables, but instead you can create walls in certain intersections to block or trap them. It's especially great on the Game Boy, with cute graphics and a steady progression of difficulty from stage to stage.
