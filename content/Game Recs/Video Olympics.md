(oneliner:: Four-player variety pong.)

Developer:: Atari
Publisher:: Atari
Release Date:: 1977-09-11
Hours:: 0.1

The best single cartridge of Pong games, supporting up to four players in a variety of sports themes. I personally like the Soccer variant, where each player controls two paddles in an interleaved layout.
