(oneliner:: Clean up the sewers as Luigi and Mario.)

Developer:: Nintendo R&D1
Publisher:: Nintendo
Release Date:: 1983-03-01
Hours:: 0.1

This single-screen platform game starring the not-yet-super Mario brothers features two-player simultaneous play, similar to the likes of [[Joust]] or [[Wizard of Wor]]. You need to eliminate the bad guys first by flipping them onto their backs (by bumping the ground they stand on from below) and then kicking them into the water. Though it controls smoothly enough to provide a satisfying challenge to a single player, it shines with two, letting you cooperate or compete with a friend.

> Trivia: This may *technically* not be the first appearance of the green Mario brother Luigi. He also appears in the 1983 *Game & Watch* game of the same name, which sees the brothers working in a bottling plant rather than as plumbers. Information about the arcade game's release month is conflicting, so it is not clear whether the *Game & Watch* game was released first, or whether the arcade and handheld games were released simultaneously.
