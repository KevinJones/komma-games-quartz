*Shark! Shark!* is an action game with an irresistibly simple premise. You're a fish who eats smaller fish while avoiding larger fishes, as well as hazards like sharks and jellyfish. If you eat enough fish, you grow larger, which means there are more kinds of fish you can eat, but you become less maneuverable, increasing the challenge.
