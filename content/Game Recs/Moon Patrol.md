(oneliner:: Police the moon, jumping over craters and shooting down flying saucers.)

Developer:: Irem
Publisher:: Irem, Williams
Release Date:: 1982-01-01
Hours:: 0.1

One of the first games to feature parallax side-scrolling. You have a cute Moon buggy and want to keep it moving to the right, without crashing into anything or getting shot down. It's a simple game but unique and vibrant enough to charm you decades later.
