*Pressure Cooker* is honestly my favorite title on the Atari 2600; it feels like it could have been made today as a retro tribute. You play as a cook who must assemble hamburgers according to customers' orders, and must avoid dropping the food on the floor, messing up the order, or taking too long. It's a much more real-world picture of food prep than [[BurgerTime]], I'll tell you that.
