(oneliner:: A visitor to Sosaria must find and destroy a magic gem.)

Developer:: Richard Garriott, Origin Systems
Publisher:: California Pacific Computer Company, Origin Systems
Release Date:: 1981-06-01
Hours:: 0.5

An early role-playing game where you play a character summoned to the world of Sosaria, tasked with finding and destroying a magical gem to free the land from an evil, immortal wizard. It popularized ideas like the open overworld map, multiple towns, and simple combat. While controlling the game is difficult and its execution is ultimately very simple, the existence of the game as history is entertaining in itself.
