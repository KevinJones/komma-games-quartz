(oneliner:: The eternal block-pushing puzzle.)

Developer:: Hiroyuki Imabayashi, Thinking Rabbit
Publisher:: Thinking Rabbit
Release Date:: 1982-01-01
Hours:: 0.2

A puzzle game, played on a square grid, where a character must push (not pull!) boxes to designated storage locations in a warehouse. Sokoban feels like an inevitability, and the concept is so intuitive that block-pushing puzzles ended up in games by hundreds of different developers, "Sokoban" fans or not. 

It's tough to name a single "classic" Sokoban version, but I recommend starting with either the 1988 C64 version or the Game Boy's *Boxxle*. If you like Sokoban, you might enjoy puzzlers like *Baba Is You*, *Patrick's Parabox*, and *Stephen's Sausage Roll*. You can also play a practically unlimited number of Sokoban puzzles at [Sokoban Online](https://www.sokobanonline.com/).
