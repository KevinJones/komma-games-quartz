The vintage arcade multitasking challenge. Customers slowly advance down one of four bars towards your character (the bartender) on the right hand side of the screen. You need to fill a mug with beer and slide it down the bar to them, then catch the mug when they return it. Worth checking out for its unique theme for action gameplay.
