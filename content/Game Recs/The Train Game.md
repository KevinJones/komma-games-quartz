*The Train Game* is a real-time train puzzle that makes effective use of the ZX Spectrum's keyboard. Basically, you see a rail system from overhead, and each switch is labelled with a letter. Pressing the corresponding letter will toggle the track. Your goal as a player is to route trains through to pick up passengers and take them to destinations without driving any of them off the rails or into other trains.
