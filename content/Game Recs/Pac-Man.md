Pac-Man is a wildly popular maze game where you control a spherical yellow man who must collect all the dots in a maze while avoiding predatory ghosts, until he collects a power-up dot that allows him to eat the ghosts. Each ghost has a slightly different personality and their movements can be predicted, giving studious players who plan ahead a huge advantage.
