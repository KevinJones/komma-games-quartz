A fairly enjoyable vintage platformer. Basically, you want to stop Dr. Frankenstein from bringing his monster to life, and the way you're doing that is by carrying bricks to build walls around the monster, avoiding obstacles on multiple layers of the screen. But the exciting part is that when you lose, the monster breaks free and marches towards the screen in the Atari 2600's most exciting game over sequence. Basically I recommend checking this out instead of *Pitfall!*.
