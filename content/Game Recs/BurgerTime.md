In *BurgerTime*, you play as a chef who needs to assemble huge hamburgers while avoiding the onslaught of pickles, hot dogs, and fried eggs. This game is best in the arcade format but was also an early hit for the Intellivision. You might also want to check out *Burger Time Deluxe* for the Game Boy.
