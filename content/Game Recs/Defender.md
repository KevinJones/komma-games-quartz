(oneliner:: Defend a landscape from space aliens.)

Developer:: Williams
Publisher:: Williams
Release Date:: 1981-03-01
Hours:: 0.1

A classic shmup where you zoom left and right, trying to blow up aliens and rescue people from a landscape. It is hard to the point where you might only survive for 10 seconds. If you like this, check out the *Fantasy Zone* games, *Aqua Kitty: Milk Mine Defender*, and *Dropzone* for the C64. It also has a pseudo-sequel called *Stargate*.
