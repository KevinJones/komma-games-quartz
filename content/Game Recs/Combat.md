(oneliner:: 2 player only. Tanks vs tanks, jets vs jets.)

Developer:: Larry Wagner, Joe Decuir
Publisher:: Atari
Release Date:: 1977-10-14
Hours:: 0.1

A two-player cart containing many variations on tank vs tank and jet vs jet scenarios. Games 6 through 9, "tank pong", are probably the best today, with you lining up shots billiards style to try to hit your opponent. The others are too simplistic and don't see you interacting with the other player in an interesting way.
