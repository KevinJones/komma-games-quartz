(oneliner:: Shoot down ballooning wolves.)

Developer:: Konami
Publisher:: Konami
Release Date:: 1982-01-01
Hours:: 0.1

Another golden age arcade game that's easy to understand despite its incredibly bizarre premise. You know the three little pigs, right? You play as the mother pig protecting her kids from hungry wolves. She wields a bow and arrow and rides a winch-controlled cage, pulled by her sons, that lets her move up and down. Your goal is to pop the balloons that carry wolves across the screen, lest they kidnap one of the kids or push a large boulder onto your cage. Anyways, that's the gist of it--shoot the bright baloons with arrows.
