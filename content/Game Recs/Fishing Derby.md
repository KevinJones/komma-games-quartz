(oneliner:: A 2-player fishing contest.)

Developer:: David Crane
Publisher:: Activision
Release Date:: 1980-01-01
Hours:: 0.1

A simple fishing contest, best with two players, where you control the tip of a fishing rod and attempt to pull 99 pounds of fish before your opponent. Fish near the bottom of the pond are worth more than ones near the top, but have a bigger risk of being intercepted by the shark lurking just under the surface.
