(oneliner:: Platform through 21st century Canadian uranium mines.)

Developer:: Big Five Software
Publisher:: Big Five Software
Release Date:: 1982-01-01
Hours:: 0.2

Another one of those arcadey platformers in the [[Donkey Kong]] tradition, featuring a large number of unique screens. You play as a man named Bounty Bob, who must clean abandoned uranium mines from radioactive waste, while avoiding the mutant creatures who dwell there. (Cool premise!) It originated on the Atari 8-bit computer family, but also plays well on the Atari 5200 and Colecovision.

As a trivia note, you can see similarities between *Miner 2049er* and later games such as *Manic Miner* (1983), *City Connection* (1985), and *Crystal Caves* (1991).
