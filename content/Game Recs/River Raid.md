(oneliner:: Shoot enemy aircraft over a river while keeping your fuel toped off.)

Developer:: Carol Shaw
Publisher:: Activision
Release Date:: 1982-01-01
Hours:: 0.1

*River Raid* is in many ways the blueprint for games like *Xevious*, *Axelay*, and *Raiden* as one of the first shooting games where you fly over a scrolling landscape. Far from obsolete, though, the game's use of fuel management and static friction were abandoned almost completely in the genre after this. This keeps *River Raid* unique, and its responsive controls and clear objective keep it interesting to play. It might by my favorite 2600 title.

Skip *River Raid 2*; it's a different game and Carol Shaw was not involved.
