(oneliner:: How quickly can you fly through barns?)

Developer:: Steve Cartwright
Publisher:: Activision
Release Date:: 1982-01-01
Hours:: 0.05

An attractive 2D flying game that makes for about a 90 second speedrun. It almost feels like a cheat to include it because of what a *tiny*  game it is, but it is definitely one of the coolest looking games on the 2600
