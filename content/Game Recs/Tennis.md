Developer:: Alan Miller
Publisher:: Activision
Release Date:: 1981-01-01

A fun, simple tennis game, hardly more complex than pong. You control an athlete who can move on two axes and automatically returns a shot that goes near them. The illusion of depth goes a long way towards making this feel compelling.
