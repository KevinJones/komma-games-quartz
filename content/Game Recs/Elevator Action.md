*Elevator Action* is all about lifts, doors, and documents. You play a secret agent named Otto who enters a tall building via the roof. He just needs to get in, grab the documents from the red doors, and get out safely. To help him out, he can make clever use of the building's elevator and escalator systems... or standard use of his pistol. Simple, exciting, and approachable in its challenge.
