(oneliner:: An anteater catches ants with its tongue.)

Developer:: Stern Electronics
Publisher:: Tago Electronics
Release Date:: 1982-01-01
Hours:: 0.1

A maze game where you control an Anteater's tongue, moving it through underground tunnels. You will push your luck and try to eat as many ants as possible. Though it wasn't a hit at the time, the unique concept inspired clones like *Aardvark* (1986), *Oil Well* (1983), and *Pipeline Run* (1990). Worth checking out if you want something unusual!
