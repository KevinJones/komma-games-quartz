"Snake" is a kind of video game where you control a line that grows in length, trying to collect food while avoiding the borders of the screen and the path traced by your own line. The first game of the genre was probably the 1976 arcade game *Blockade*, (unofficially ported to home consoles in 1977 as *Surround*) and it was immortalized in a little game called *Snake* preloaded on Nokia mobile phones beginning in 1998. *Snake Byte*, here, is a solid version of the concept (later imitated by the 1992 *Rattler Race* game included in the second *Microsoft Entertainment Pack*) that was programmed by the future creator of *Chip's Challenge*.
