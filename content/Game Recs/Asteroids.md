(oneliner:: Shoot space rocks.)

Developer:: Atari
Publisher:: Atari
Release Date:: 1979-11-01
Hours:: 0.1

A space shooting game where you rotate and thrust a spaceship while trying to shoot at rocks floating around the screen. Avoid crashing into any debris or being shot down by the marauding alien to survive. It's a great usage of vector graphics. This static screen arena format has become a staple for freeware developers and influenced later commercial games like [[Geometry Wars]].

See [Space Duel](gamerecs/Space%20Duel.md) for a multiplayer version.
