Release Date:: 1983-03-01
Hours:: 0.1

I have a soft spot for this somewhat-obscure game. It's just a great little tube shooter that incorporates classical music motifs. A bit more straight-forward and consistent than [[Tempest]], with sprite graphics for those who prefer them. Simple, stylish, and challenging.

*Gyruss* was ported from the arcade to many home systems. Of these I enthusiastically recommend the NES version from 1989.
