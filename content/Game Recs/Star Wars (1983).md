If you're a fan of *Star Wars: A New Hope* then you don't need the scenario of this game explained to you. Basically, you use analog controls to shoot at enemy TIE Fighters (rendered in striking vector graphics) as they appear. Some alternate gameplay phases as you approach the exhaust port target give it a bit of variety.
