A cute but rather challenging maze game recommended for fans of puzzles and penguins. Our protagonist is a red penguin who must defeat slimy Sno-Bees by sliding large blocks of ice into them. Levels usually start with a tight maze layout that gradually opens up as Pengo breaks through the ice.

The game's background music is a mildly infuriating rendition of [Popcorn](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBYjZTdrJlA) by Gershon Kingsley.
