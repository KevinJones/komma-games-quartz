(oneliner:: Climb ladders, dig pits to trap enemies, and collect gold.)

Developer:: Doug Smith
Publisher:: Broderbund
Release Date:: 1983-01-01
Hours:: 2

*Lode Runner* is a classic puzzle. You have a simple objective on each screen: collect all the gold and escape while evading your enemies. While it's fairly easy to understand, there are some outright fiendish levels later on that will ask you to plan your route several steps ahead, digging through multiple layers of the world. There have been many great iterations of this franchise, notably Sierra's *Lode Runner Online* (1995) and Hudson Soft's NES versions.
