9 player segments emerged when conducting a clustering analysis of the roughly 500,000 gamers who took the Gamer Motivation Profile survey. They are:
- The Acrobat
- The Gardener
- The Slayer
- The Gladiator
- The Ninja
- The Bounty Hunter
- The Architect
- The Bard

(Tag yourself.)

**The Acrobat**: a solo gamer who primarily wants to take on challenging gameplay, practicing over and over again until they can take on the most difficult missions and bosses in the games. They enjoy games like Spelunky, Celeste, Super Metroid, and Tetris.

**The Gardener**: a gamer looking for quiet, relaxing task completion. They want gameplay where the rules are presented upfront, as directly as possible, and the gameplay itself is spontaneous rather than planned out in advance. They enjoy games like Candy Crush and Animal Crossing.

**The Slayer**: a gamer who wants cinematic destruction; chaos and mayhem in the context of a rich game world with an overarching story. They typically enjoy on-rails action-adventure games like Uncharted and Tomb Raider, plus cinematic experiences like Firewatch or INSIDE.

**The Gladiator**: a self-described "hardcore" gamer looking for epic games with a broad spectrum of features including: power progression, team arenas, fast-paced play, challenges that require strategic thinking, and a rich world with tons of lore. They often enjoy games like Destiny, Gears of War, Black Desert Online, or Monster Hunter.

**The Ninja**: a gamer who wants to take on difficult challenges that also involve strategic decision making, fast-paced play, and competition. They are less driven by in-game progression as they are driven by skill-based mastery. They often play games like StarCraft, Street Fighter, Super Smash Brothers, osu!, or League of Legends.

**The Bounty Hunter**: a gamer who wants an open game world they can make their own through customization and exploration. They want to explore stuff, build stuff, and power up their characters in the context of the world. Popular games for the bounty hunter include titles like Saints Row, Far Cry, and Mass Effect. (I'd also put stuff like The Elder Scrolls and Fallout here.)

**The Architect**: a gamer who wants planning and decision-making that leads to progression and task completion, often in a game with an interesting setting or story. They strongly prefer solo gameplay with games that are slow-paced, relaxing, and serene. They often play games like Civilization, Europa Universalis, Banished, or Pillars of Eternity.

**The Bard**: a social gamer who wants to chat and interact with other players in game worlds that are rich with lore, stories, discovery, and customization. They care little about power progression and task completion, and want to just experience the game world organically. Their popular games include titles like The Secret World, Final Fantasy XIV, and Animal Crossing.

## Limitations

> There isn't a one-size-fits-all player segment model that works for every situation.

First, these are more like paint colors you can mix together than separate buckets. 

This segment model provides a broad taxonomy for gamers as a whole, but they read like caricatures of genres--you lose nuance and granularity when you try to segment all gamers. If you're making an Open World Action-Adventure game then the largest block of players in your audience will be Bounty Hunters--but so what? You probably already knew that. You will need more data if you're working within a specific genre or a specific game title. They suggest working with just a sample of players who care about your genre or franchise.
