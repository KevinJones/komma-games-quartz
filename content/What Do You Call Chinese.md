**In short, it depends.** When I say "Chinese" or "Mandarin Chinese", I'm referring to the modern, standardized form of Mandarin Chinese; the same one that's used in the United Nations.

The full term is:

|           |                        |
| --------- | ---------------------- |
| trad.     | 現代標準漢語           |
| simp.     | **现代标准汉语**           |
| pinyin    | xiàndài biāozhǔn hànyǔ |
| literally | modern (现代) standard (标准) Han speech (汉语)                       |

...but this isn't what you would call it in everyday conversation.

Chinese speakers in mainland China call it 普通話 / **普通话** = _Pǔtōnghuà_ = common speech.

Chinese speakers in Taiwan call it  國語 / **国语** = _Guóyǔ_ = national language.

Chinese speakers in Malaysia call it 華語 / **华语** = _Huáyǔ_ = Hua (Chinese) language.

But the most general term for spoken Chinese is 漢語 / **汉语** = _Hànyǔ_ = Han speech. This word can refer to written Chinese depending on context, or imply 普通話 / **普通话** (_Pǔtōnghuà_) in contrast to a minority dialect.

The largest of the Chinese dialect groups is called 官話 / **官话** = _Guānhuà_ = official speech. In English we call it "Mandarin", which comes from the Portuguese *mandarim* and ultimately from the Sanksrit _mantrī_, meaning "language of the officials". It's spoken across most of northern and southwestern China.
