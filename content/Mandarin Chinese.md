## Learning Strats

Standard Mandarin Chinese

easy things about chinese
- no tenses, no plurals, no subject-verb agreement
- writing system is surprisingly mnemonic
- hanyu pinyin

challenges about chinese
- tones, measure words, discourse particles
- does not use an alphabet or syllabary

Question: should *you* learn simplified characters or traditional?
- most native Chinese speakers are able to write in only one of the two systems, though they can usually read both
- it is easier for people who learn Traditional to read both sets
- Simplified characters are less intimidating for beginners
- (which is more similar to the Japanese forms?)
- "if you like the traditional meanings and history of the charcters, learn traditional"
- for me, because of the overlap with Japanese, **I'll learn traditional** (since I'll mostly be typing it than writing it out)
	- Note: Mandarin contains homonyms. There's no way around the need to recognize and produce the hanzi.

Parts of a syllable
- every Mandarin syllable has three parts: initials, finals, and tones
- there are four **tone** marks: ˉ, ˊ, ˇ, and ˋ.
    - ˉ, first tone. starts and stays high.
    - ˊ, second tone. starts mid, goes high.
    - ˇ, third tone. starts low, dips, then goes high.
	    - changes depending on context.
	    - if it comes before another third tone, it is pronounced as a second tone.
	    - if it comes before any other tone, then it only dips.
	    - only when it's spoken on its own or ending a sentence does it go high at the end.
    - ˋ, fourth tone. starts high and dives to the bottom.
    - some syllables don't have a tone or tone mark. they take their tone from the syllable before them.
	    - following a first or second tone syllable: mid-range.
	    - following a third-tone syllable: high, as if the rebound continues right into it.
	    - following a fourth-tone syllable: low, as if the dip continues right into it.
- the **initial** is in the beginning of a syllable. It is usually a consonant (except *y* or *w* in some cases) and usually one letter (except for *zh*, *ch*, and *sh*).
- the **final** is afterthing after the initial aside from the tone mark. It begins with a vowel and ends with a vowel, *n*, *ng*, or *r*. A syllable can have 1 or 2 finals.

However, some syllables have no initial or final.
- no final
    - unpronounced *i* is added to the end of the syllable
    - this can only occur with the following initials: *zh ch sh r z c s*
- no initial
    - if final begins with *i*, it is replaced with a *y*
    - if the final begins with *u*, it is replaced with *w*
    - if the final begins with *ü*, it is replaced with *yu*
    - exceptions
        - *i* alone is replaced by *yi*
        - *in* is replaced by *yin*
        - *ing* is replaced by *ying*
        - *iu* is replaced by *you*
        - *u* alone is replaced by *wu*
        - *ui* is replaced by *wei*
        - *un* is replaced by *wen*
        - *ueng* is replaced by *weng*

When ü is combined with the initials *j q x y*, the umlaut is removed.
