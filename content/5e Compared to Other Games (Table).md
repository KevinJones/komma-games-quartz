| Traps                         | traps are usually spotted with passive Wisdom (Perception). No particular "disarm trap action". Disarming depends on trap type, often a Dexterity check using proficient thieves's tools. Any class can be a disarmer. | Separate kinds of rolls for searching rooms for room traps vs searching an item/chest for treasure traps. Repeat treasure trap roll to disarm it. You typically need a good thief to safely disarm treasure traps, but anyone can potentially find room traps. | Thieves have a % Find/Remove Traps skill. To find traps, the thief says they're searching a single object or 10' area and the GM rolls in secret. To disarm a found trap, the thief must roll below their skill + modifiers. Only 96-100 springs the trap. | hazards (traps) are spotted with Perception score vs hazard's Stealth DC. Typically safely disabled with the Disable a Device action of the Thievery skill. (similar rules for environmental hazards vs Nature/Survival, and hauntings vs Occultism/Religion) | Traps MUST be forewarned by the GM with narrative clues, but GM doesn't have to allow a check to perceive, disarm, or avoid a trap.           |
| Random Encounters             | has rules for random encounters. Sample tables for random encounters in cities, in a sylvan forest, at sea, and underwater, but weirdly not inside a dungeon.                                                          | wandering monsters rules, with frequency based on noise level and type of environment. Typically a 1-in-6 chance once every two turns (20 minutes)                                                                                                             | instructions for making random encounter tables using the provided bestiary, incl non-monster encounters.

Initiative is a d6 rolled every round, and tie = both sides go simultaneously. (Optional rule for individual turns) | side turns; every round, GM decides monster actions, then PCs declare actions, then 1d10 initiative is rolled per party. Actions are resolved in order of initiative. Some actions delay an individual's initiative. Characters generally get one action per turn, which may allow full, half, or no movement. Tie = both sides go simultaneously. | individual turns; 3 actions per combat turn, plus 1 reaction per round.
