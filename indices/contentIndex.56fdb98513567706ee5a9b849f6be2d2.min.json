{"/":{"title":"Komma Games Notebook","content":"\nWelcome! I'm Kevin, but online people mostly call me Komma Chameleon. This website is an open notebook; a digital garden of my research and thoughts on subjects like writing, history, nature, foreign languages, and games of all kinds. My goal is to build up a public body of knowledge that anybody can wander through.\n\n## Where to start?\n\n- [[About Me]] and my [[Rules for Using This Vault]]\n- Maps\n\t- Learn about my [[Game Reviews and Recommendations]]\n\t- Check out my [[Project List]]\n\t- Enjoy gaming in a variety of formats: [[Video Gaming]], [[Board Gaming]], and [[TTRPG Gaming]] \n\t- My gamedev/writing [[Worldbuilding]]\n\t- My notes on [[Human Languages]]\n\t- [[Programming]] and [[Gamedev]] notes\n\t- My niche [[Furry]] content\n- Key tags\n\t- \\#best\n\t- \\#essays that cover my personal thoughts\n- ...or pick a recently updated note from the list at the bottom of this page!\n\n## What you should expect\n\n**I might be wrong.** This notebook is an act of learning and creating in public. It may occasionally contain factual errors, misleading phrases, or omit critical context. Please don't hold this against me. We're all learners! I encourage you to refer to multiple sources about anything important.\n\nI am **explicitly inviting you to criticize my work.** Every page in here is a living document. You can reach me at any of the social media links included in the footer on each page. (Telegram works best.) I will do my best to act on feedback and correct my notes. If this disagreement is a matter of opinion, I encourage you to write and publish your own thoughts in your own notebook.\n\n**License.** Except where indicated otherwise, each note is licensed under a [Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/). You are welcome to quote the notes and link back here, but please don't plagiarize. If you think there's something that shouldn't be here, let me know.\n\n## What I promise to you\n\n**I will always take others into consideration.** This notebook will contain no private conversations or confidential information. If I talk negatively about a game, an idea, or a project, I will try to limit that to the *work*, not the people who worked on it or said it. I will strive to treat others the way they want to be treated.\n\n**I will provide personal context for beliefs and notes.** I'll let you know what degree of experience I have in the topic, how strongly I hold a belief, and link out to resources where you can learn more. In line with this goal, I've adopted these tags:\n\n- \\#fleeting for early, rough ideas.\n- \\#journal for my thoughts or experiences tied to a specific date.\n- \\#lit - an informational note from a specific book, article, video, etc.\n- \\#atom - a permanent, valuable note that captures a single idea.\n- \\#map - note that exists to organize other notes (like this index).\n\n**I will make fictional contexts clear** when I'm discussing a detail of a fictional property or my own worldbuilding. I do not want anybody to get confused between fiction and reality.\n\n**No filler text** generated by an AI language model or similar tool. I aim to be authentically human, warts and all.\n\n**I will try to reward feedback, but can't promise to agree or respond to all of it.** I ultimately run this website for my own benefit, so I will not beg for views or feedback. I will listen to feedback and correct things I get wrong as soon as I can. However, I don't write with the rigor of an academic.","lastmodified":"2023-11-25T02:57:26.995165927Z","tags":[]},"/10-Major-Language-Families":{"title":"10 Major Language Families","content":"#languages #quartz-sync \n\nA language family is a classification of languages that all descend from a common ancestor, called the proto-language of the family. The ten language families with the most speakers, and examples of modern languages in the family:\n\n[[Indo-European Language Family]] - 3.2 billion estimated speakers - English, Spanish, Hindi\n[[Sino-Tibetan Language Family]] - 1.4 billion - Mandarin Chinese\n[[Atlantic-Congo and Niger-Congo Language Family]] - 500 million - Swahili, Yoruba\n[[Afroasiatic Language Family]] - 500 million - Arabic\n[[Austronesian Language Family]] - 325 million - Malay, Tagalog\n[[Dravidian Language Family]] - 250 million - Telegu, Tamil\n[[Turkic Language Family]] - 180 million - Turkic, Uzbek\n[[Japonic Language Family]] - 130 million - Japanese\n[[Austroasiatic Language Family]] - 115 million - Vietnamese, Khmer\n[[Koreanic Language Family]] - 77 million - Korean\n\nWe don't quite know where language come from, but linguistic scholars generally hypothesize that it evolved from earlier pre-linguistic systems. It is possible that there was a single common ancestor language spoken by the first genetically modern humans in Africa, but language's use far predates writing and leaves no physical evidence, so we might never know for sure.","lastmodified":"2023-11-25T02:57:26.991165934Z","tags":[]},"/10x-Developer-Myth":{"title":"10x Developer Myth","content":"#programming #quartz-sync \n\nThe term 10x Developer is a myth. It is a belief that there are some people who are *so good*, they can solve software problems in 1/10th the time and do it ten times better.\n\nLet's analyze a couple of places this belief might have come from.\n## Steve Jobs?\n\nIn 1995, Steve Jobs said:\n\n\u003e I observed something fairly early on at Apple, which I didn’t know how to explain then, but have thought a lot about it since. Most things in life have a dynamic range in which average to best is at most 2:1. For example if you go to New York City and get an average taxi cab driver versus the best taxi cab driver, you’ll probably get to your destination with the best taxi driver 30% faster. And an automobile; What’s the difference between the average car and the best? Maybe 20% ?  The best CD player versus the average CD player? Maybe 20% ? So 2:1 is a big dynamic range for most things in life. Now, in software, and it used to be the case in hardware, **the difference between the average software developer and the best is 50:1; Maybe even 100:1.** Very few things in life are like this, but what I was lucky enough to spend my life doing, which is software, is like this. So I’ve built a lot of my success on finding these truly gifted people, and not settling for ‘B’ and ‘C’ players, but really going for the ‘A’ players. And I found something… **I found that when you get enough ‘A’ players together; when you go through the incredible work to find these ‘A’ players, they really like working with each other.** Because most have never had the chance to do that before. And they dont work with ‘B’ and ‘C’ players, so its self policing. They only want to hire ‘A’ players. So you build these pockets of ‘A’ players and it just propagates.\n\u003e \n\u003e (Source: Cringely, R. X. (2012). Steve Jobs: The Lost Interview \\[Film\\]. United States; Magnolia Pictures.)\n\nThis quote appears in *Steve Jobs: The Lost Interview*; an 70-minute interview recorded in 1995 and released in 2012. This was after he had left Apple but before Apple bought NeXT.\n\nLet's break it down a little. He proposes:\n- Software development is somehow different from \"most things in life\" -- other professional fields?\n- It is better to put the effort in to find the \"A\" players, rather than settling for B and C players.\n- \"A\" players are also good at hiring other A players.\n\nThiiis may or may not be true. Hmm.\n\nBut there's also an older source.\n\n## Coding War Games \n\nSoftware engineers Tom DeMarco and Tim Lister, authors of the book *Peopleware: Productive Projects in Teams* (1987),  conducted a productivity survey called the Coding War Games beginning in 1977. According to data from over 600 developers, they concluded:\n\n- Choice of programming language had little impact on productivity, with the exception of assembly language.\n- There wasn't a correlation between performance and experience, except that developers with less than six months of experience in a language were not as productive.\n- There were huge difference between organizations, with the best organization working 11.1 times faster than the worst. The study authors attributed this to the **workplace environment**--quiet, private, dedicated working space leads to better performance.\n\nThis might be where the ten in \"10x\" comes from, since the best organization was about ten times faster than the worst. However, this isn't a measure of individuals, and the third bullet point here emphasizes likely causes for the difference in performance.\n\n## Other notes\n\nLinus Torvalds and John Carmack exist, sure, but your boss can't hire them to work on your random web project. You might spend your whole life and not do what Torvalds did, but nobody needs to invent Linux twice. If you set up Carmack to do something he doesn't know or care about, he would not be productive either. Resist the urge to mythologize prominent programmers and compare everybody to them.  \n\nWhat you can actually do to be more productive?\n- reduce distractions and allow flow to happen\n- develop deep subject matter expertise in a relevant problem; or choose problems relevant to your area of expertise.\n- know that it's okay to be a \"rocket turtle\"; somebody who is slow at first (reading documentation, following tutorials, etc) but speeds up and leaves clean code behind.\n- sometimes it's okay to drop everything to focus on a tough problem\n\n----\n\nhttps://medium.com/ingeniouslysimple/the-origins-of-the-10x-developer-2e0177ecef60\n\nhttps://www.simplethread.com/the-10x-programmer-myth/ - offers a manager's perspectives on developer archetypes that might get extra praise or too little praise.","lastmodified":"2023-11-25T02:57:26.991165934Z","tags":[]},"/2D-Affine-Transformation-Matrix":{"title":"2D Affine Transformation Matrix","content":"\nAn affine transformation is one that keeps lines parallel, but not necessarily angles and distances.\n\n![[2d affine transformation matrix latex.png]]\n\n\n```\n[   a    c    tx\n\tb    d    ty\n\t0    0    1    ]\n```\n\na, b, c, and d are used for things like scaling, rotation, shear, and so on. tx and ty are translations.

You typically need a good thief to safely disarm treasure traps, but anyone can potentially find room traps. | Thieves have a % Find/Remove Traps skill. To find traps, the thief says they're searching a single object or 10' area and the GM rolls in secret. To disarm a found trap, the thief must roll below their skill + modifiers. Only 96-100 springs the trap. | hazards (traps) are spotted with Perception score vs hazard's Stealth DC. Typically safely disabled with the Disable a Device action of the Thievery skill.

When we use the term \"API\", we can refer either to the document detailing how to create and use this connection, or the actual implemented connection itself.\n\nYou can think of an API as a counterpart to a UI (user interface). A user interface communicates messages between a computer program and a human person, often by displaying graphics, printing out text, and making noises. An API, by contrast, is only meant to be seen by a programmer who wants to incorporate it into other software. You might think of an API like a menu at a restaurant or a car wash--a list of capabilities, the information required to use them, and sometimes what you get back in return. There different terms to describe these, depending on the particular technologies involved: methods, endpoints, subroutines, definitions, or requests.\n\nSometimes an API is just a standard way of communicating between multiple programs, where both the calling software and the receiving software can be implemented in whatever way satisfies the API's needs. For example, Microsoft maintains the Windows API from older versions of its operating system, so that old applications (callers) can keep running on newer versions of Windows (the receiver).","lastmodified":"2023-11-25T02:57:26.991165934Z","tags":["quartz-sync"]},"/About-Me":{"title":"About Me","content":"\n#best #quartz-sync \n\nI'm Kevin, known online mostly by my alias Komma Chameleon. I am a millennial born and raised in the southeast United States. (I don't always love it, but I don't have any plans to leave, either.) My educational background is in computer science (Georgia Tech, 2012) but my interests also include foreign languages, history, nature, writing, and games of every sort. What I want to do is bring ideas from my head into reality, to make the world a better place than it was when I found it, and to help the good people of the world treat each other with a little bit more calm and kindness.\n\nI am an asexual cisgender man (though somewhat of an androphile) and support all members of the LGBTQIA+ community. I wish to say in no uncertain terms that trans men are men, trans women are women, and [[Trans Rights Are Human Rights]], and additionally that Black lives matter. I have also been a member of the furry fandom for the better part of two decades, and for all its ups and downs it has been a constant source of friendship, inspiration, and challenging ideas in my life. My [[fursona]] is an anthropomorphic chameleon who gives very good hugs.\n\nI think something I value most is authenticity. I want to be mindful of my experiences in life, how my own acts and thoughts have shaped them, and the extent to which I allow myself to be shaped by them. I must be true to myself, truthful to others, and dishonest never. By being authentic, I can exercise kindness in everything I do, without getting stuck on some ulterior motivation. Along with this, I embrace creativity in artistic expression and problem solving. I process information critically and keep my mind open to other possibilities. While it can be exhausting, I love to learn, and I am eager to understand what new kinds of beauty exist in the world.\n\nIn terms of technical skills, my favorite [programming](#programming) languages are C#, TypeScript, and Python. The toolbox also includes JavaScript, C, C++, Java, Lua, and a touch of Rust, Kotlin, and Objective-C. (I prefer TypeScript over JavaScript and Kotlin over Java whenever possible.) I have worked on games in Godot, Unity, Cocos2D-X, and CreateJS, and deployed them to platforms including the iOS App Store and the mobile web, with game prototypes playable on all major desktop operating systems. I have some exposure to emscripten. Markdown is my preferred syntax for blogging and note-taking, typically alongside Joplin (my old fave) or Obsidian (my new fave), although I am comfortable with HTML, CSS, and JSON blobs as well. I am a confident writer and my peers have often complimented my project organization skills. Other people trust me for my technical advice.\n\nIt is no secret that [I am a fan of video games](Game Recommendations). I grew up playing the likes of *Commander Keen* and *Lemmings* alongside classic entries in the Nintendo catalog, and continue to keep up with the industry's biggest surprises and independent hits. I also adore the design sense of modern board games like *Root* and *Race for the Galaxy*, and have a harmless obsession with reading through tabletop RPG books and daydreaming about all the possible adventures they promise. (Alas, few are able to slay that dread beast, Scheduling.) With the advent of streaming video, my interest in Japanese video games bloomed into an appreciation for all kinds of international media. I count *The Diving Bell and the Butterfly* and *Portrait of a Lady on Fire* among my favorite films alongside *Princess Mononoke* and just-plain-fun series like *Death Note*.","lastmodified":"2023-11-25T02:57:26.991165934Z","tags":[]},"/About-the-Chinese-Language":{"title":"About the Chinese Language","content":"- Speakers\n\t- 1.35 billion native speakers across all of its varieties\n\t- Mandarin Chinese is the official language of China, Singapore, and Taiwan\n\t- Cantonese is the official language of Hong Kong and Macau\n\t- Significant number of Chinese speakers abroad, such as in the Chinatowns in New York City and San Francisco. Chinese is the third most spoken language in the Unite States and Canada. (Though in the US, Cantonese has been been common than Mandarin.)\n- **Key Points**\n\t- You will learn **pinyin** to understand how to pronounce words and syllables using the Latin alphabet.\n\t- Mandarin uses **four tones** and a neutral tone to distinguish words. Tones can change the meaning of a word, even if the consonant and vowel sounds stay the same. Pinyin includes tone markers to help your pronunciation.\n\t- Each Chinese character is a **logogram**, representing a one-syllable word or a morpheme (unit of meaning). You will learn one of the two writing systems, either the Simplified Chinese character system (used in mainand China and Singapore) or the traditional system (used in Hong Kong, Taiwan, Macau, and Chinese-speaking communities outside mainland China).\n\t- Chinese is traditionally written right to left, top to bottom in columns. However, on computers and more contemporary writing, **writing left to right and top to bottom in rows (like English) is quite common**.\n\t- Chinese has **few grammatical inflections**. This means there are no tenses (past, future), no numbers (singular, plural), no voices (active voice, passive voice), and only a handful of articles. (\"the, a, an\")\n\t- In contrast, the **word order and sentence structure** is very important to the sentence's meaning. The language also makes **heavy use of grammatical particles**; like adding the word 吧 (_ba_) to turn a statement into a question or suggestion.\n\t- Chinese uses a **SVO word order like English** (Subject-verb-object, \"Cows eat grass.\"), and commonly uses **topic-comment** construction.\n\t\t- This differs from the east Asian languages Japanese and Korean, which use SOV.\n\t- About 10,000 Chinese characters are in use today, but only about 3,000 are frequently used. A reference dictionary on standard Chinese defines about 70,000 words. If you **learn the 3,000 most common characters** and the compounds they're used in, you should be able to read a Mainland China newspaper.\n- Varieties\n\t- Considered by native speakers to be dialects of a single language, but they aren't utually intelligible.\n\t- The variety with most speakers is Mandarin (about 800 million)\n\t- then Min (75 million), Wu (74 million), Yue (68 million, including Cantonese)\n- Writing systems\n\t- Chinese characters, aka Hanzi, in two forms \n\t\t- traditional characters, which emerged during the Han dynasty, around 200 BC\n\t\t- simplified characters, promoted for use by the government of China since 1956\n\t- Zhuyin, aka Bopomofo, a transliteration system commonly used in Taiwan, introduced in mainland china in the 1910s and adopted by Taiwan in 1945.\n\t- Pinyin, a romanization system used to teach Mandarin to students familiar with the Latin alphabet. Dates back to the 1950s.\n\t- In the United states, most Chinese as a foreign language classes teach simplified characters and Standard Mandarin Chinese.\n- History\n\t- over 3,000 years old\n\t- \"Old Chinese\" - used during the Shang dynasty and Zhou dynasty; starting from the 1700s BCE\n\t- \"Middle Chinese\" - used during the Sui dynasty, Tang dynasty, Song dynasty; starting from 500 AD\n\t- \"Classical Chinese\" or \"Literary Chinese\" - the language of classic literature used for formal writing  between 5th century BCE until the 10th century; different from any modern spoken form of Chinese. Generally speaking, spoken Chinese changed faster than written Chinese.\n\t- \"Old Mandarin\" - a common speech that emerged in northern China after the fall of the Northern Song dynasty. A major source for this language is the *Zhongyuan Yinyun* (1324) dictionary. It shares many features of modern Mandarin dialects.\n\t- \"Mandarin\" - the language spoken by officials of the Ming and Qing dynasties for practical purposes; sharing characteristics with the dialects in the Nanjing area but not the same as any single dialect. It became dominant by around 1850.\n\t- \"Standard Chinese\" - adopted in 1932 when the National Language Unification Commission settled on the Beijing dialect as the standard national language of the Republic of China. The People's Republic retained the standard when it was founded in 1949.\n\t- \"Cantonese\" - the variety of Chinese local to Hong Kong and Macau and used in education, media, and everyday life; though Mandarin is also taught in schools.\n- Chinese and Loanwords\n\t- Chinese has an influence on Korean, Japanese, and Vietnamese similar to that of Latin and Ancient Greek on European languages.

Fun. Fun for everyone! -Satoru Iwata\n\nSuppose you're a game designer. You have made it your objective to create a game and make it fun. Perhaps you've taken inspiration from the late Nintendo president Satoru Iwata. Maybe it's because you're a working professional, and you believe that a game that's more fun will sell better. (It certainly has to be \"fun enough\"!) Or maybe you're an artist, or a hobbyist with a loftier goal: doing what you can to make the human experience a little bit better by creating that elusive feeling of fun. There's just one problem.\n\nWhat is \"fun\"?\n\nOne way to answer the question is to be as literal as possible. Fun entails a physiological response. It is a perception of novelty that stimulates the brain into releasing a communication chemical (or *neurotransmitter*) called dopamine. The dopamine stimulates the amygdala, a cluster of the brain that processes memory and emotions. Fun is something that tells your brain to create a pleasant feeling, and associate that feeling with the memory of the fun activity.\n\nTo the creator of art, this is somewhat helpful to know. There are a million ways to stimulate the brain, and fun could be a part of any one of them. If we think about the word \"fun\" itself, it describes something pleasant, personal, yet unpredictable. If you repeat something fun too often, it stops being fun; watch your favorite movie three times in a row to see how. A strong focus on goals and external rewards can turn a fun activity into a job. It is the nature of fun to defy easy definition.\n\nI propose this: let's flip the question on its head. Instead of saying \"People want games that are fun. What is fun?\" let's say \"Fun is the thing the players want. What do they want?\" Why does a person play games? What motivates them to come back to the hobby, time and again? There are a couple older models worth mentioning, like the [[Bartle Taxonomy]] and \"[[Timmy, Johnny, and Spike]],\" but I want to focus on Marc LeBlanc's \"Eight Kinds of Fun\" and the \"Gamer Motivation Model\" developed by the market research company Quantic Foundry.\n\n## Eight Kinds of Fun\n\nGame designer and educator Marc LeBlanc proposed the following non-exhaustive list to explain the different kinds of fun.\n\n1. Sensation: sense-pleasure\n2. Fantasy: make-believe\n3. Narrative: story\n4. Challenge: obstacle course\n5. Fellowship: social framework\n6. Discovery: uncharted territory\n7. Expression: self-discovery\n8. Submission: pastime\n\nYou can see these explained in context in [Hunickle, LeBlanc, Zubek (2004)](http://www.cs.northwestern.edu/~hunicke/pubs/MDA.pdf). This paper explains something called the *MDA framework*, a formal way of looking at how people take in game artifacts. In simplest terms, a designer implements Mechanics (rules) that interact to create Dynamics (a system) that evoke in the player certain Aesthetics (desirable emotional responses, \"fun\").\n\n(This use of the word \"aesthetics\" is different from its common use, where it refers to something's visual style.)\n\nTo a game designer, **fun is a desirable emotional response; any feeling that motivates play.** It could be one of these eight kinds, or something totally different. It might even include some negative emotion to accentuate a positive, like fear leading to excitement, frustration leading to satisfaction, or sadness leading to catharsis.\n\nLet's break each of these down further.\n\n1. **Sensation**. The game as sense-pleasure. The game is a joy to touch. It is so pretty to look at and pleasant to listen to that a player can't help but smile.\n2. **Fantasy**. The game as make-believe. This means you're able to play a role you're not able to in real life, like a dragon-slaying heroine, a fast-driving outlaw, or the mayor of a village of animals.\n3. **Narrative**. The game as an unfolding story. This might be drama you witness, where your game interactions connect you with the world and characters. Or, it might be a plotline that changes depending on your play.\n4. **Challenge**. The game as an obstacle course. This kind of fun is the satisfaction you get from overcoming an arbitrary hurdle. Note that this isn't synonymous with difficulty. A designer doesn't always need to give players failure to challenge them.\n5. **Fellowship**. The game as a social framework. As designers, we can express this as *Cooperation* or *Competition*. In cooperative fellowship, players work together as a group to achieve a goal in the game. In competitive fellowship, players agree to compete, so they may pursue the pleasure of besting another real human being. Fellowship might also mean chatting and interacting with other people through an avatar.\n6. **Discovery**. The game as uncharted territory. It's fun to see new things, explore new places, and analyze the intricacies of a game system.\n7. **Expression**. These are games that let you express some aspect of yourself. You might build structures, design outfits, act out a character's personality, or execute a plan of your own invention.\n8. **Submission**. The game as a mindless pastime. This word might sound scary, like you're surrendering your free will to a machine. It shouldn't! In the human experience, it can be very helpful to have something to help pass the time while your mind focuses elsewhere. Some people will enjoy a phone puzzle to pass fifteen minutes while waiting for the bus. At other times, people crave a massive adventure where they can spend hours completing tasks when they are too tired to do anything else.\n\nI personally find that a game can be best described as focusing on two to four kinds of fun. This doesn't mean they are absent of the other kinds of fun; just that they aren't the focus. Also remember that this taxonomy is non-exhaustive. There might be other kinds of fun--other desirable emotional responses--that aren't covered by these eight. You might also consider ones that are more specific; you might distinguish between *narrative* filled with jokes and *narrative* filled with political intrigue.\n\nDifferent kinds of fun may come at odds with each other during the design process. For example, increasing the costs of a player's powerful wizard spells might make the game a more satisfying Challenge. The same design choice will hurt the Fantasy of being a powerful magician. For a second example, lavish visuals and prominent music may add to a game's Sensation pleasures. Yet that change may reduce the clarity needed for competitors to find Fellowship. You should try to understand which kinds of fun your experience keeps in focus in order to weigh the trade-offs and make better design choices.\n\n### Examples\n\nTo better understand fun, let's take a look at some popular video games and board games and ask what aesthetics they appeal to.\n\n- *Super Mario Brothers* is about:\n\t- the Challenge of helping Mario run and jump safely from the start of one level to the next, \n\t- the Sensation of his expertly-tuned physics and chipper sound effects, and \n\t- the Discovery of the tricks and secrets hidden in every level.\n- *Tetris Effect* appeals to Sensation with its interactive music and spectacular backgrounds. It appeals to Submission with its simple rules, variety of difficulty levels, and endless challenge modes.\n- *Red Dead Redemption 2* appeals to:\n\t- the Fantasy of being a cowboy outlaw, \n\t- the Discovery of the landmarks and sights of the wild west, and \n\t- the Narrative of Arthur Morgan's dramatic quest for survival.\n- *Earthbound* has:\n\t- a strange, sentimental Narrative about psychic kids trying to stop a covert invasion of space aliens, with \n\t- the Sensation of its poppy sample-based soundtrack and \n\t- the Discovery of its distinct towns, funny enemies, and exotic destinations.\n- *Pandemic* is a board game where a Fellowship of friends cooperate to win or lose. They engage with the Fantasy of being a team of medical experts tasked with eradicating a global pandemic. Players must overcome the game's considerable strategic Challenge by thinking together.\n- Key to *Magic the Gathering* is the Discovery of countless card combinations that players can build into personalized decks. A player might try to make their deck strong or fill it with amusing shenanigans. Some players seek the game's Competitive Fellowship, honing their tactics and deck construction. Others see their decks as an opportunity for self-Expression by picking the mana colors and card themes they enjoy the most.\n- *Minecraft* is an open-ended sandbox often played for Fellowship in a tight community of players. Each player may choose a different goal, depending on what they find fun. Some may seek Expression by gathering the materials needed to build elaborate homes. Some may try to Discover the world's natural wonders, villages, or underground resource deposits. Others might enjoy hanging out.\n- The *Diablo* games are action RPGs ideal for Submission. Treasure is plentiful. Character upgrades are frequent but not always predictable. Objectives, usually wiping a bunch of demons and undead, are clear and satisfying. Diablo's cooperative play supports Fellowship. Its elite monsters and unlockable difficulty levels create Challenge. The variety of playable character archetypes help players fulfill the Fantasy; each can be their favorite kind of gothic hero.\n\nTry analyzing one of your favorite games using these ideas. What kinds of fun does it favor? How might you change the game if you wanted to emphasize a different kind of fun? Using *Super Mario Brothers* as an example, you could make it a better tool of Expression by including a level editor and allowing players to share their creations with others, and allowing players to unlock more building blocks for their own levels by clearing associated challenges in the game's platforming mode. A team of designers did exactly this when creating *Mario Maker*.\n\n## Quantic Foundry gamer motivation model from Yee and Ducheneaut\n\nQuantic Foundry is a video game analytics/marketing research firm. They used data science and a massive amount of survey data (collected from the [gamer motivation profile](https://apps.quanticfoundry.com/surveys/start/gamerprofile/) survey, which you can take for free online) to create the \"Gamer Motivation Model\"; an attempt to describe why people play games and the different preferences of those gamers. This model was developed by the company's co-founders, Nick Yee and Nicolas Ducheneaut, both scientists with academic backgrounds. If you want to know more about their methods, this [2016 GDC Talk](https://quanticfoundry.com/2016/04/07/gdc-talk/) might be illuminating, but if you just want the bottom line, keep reading.\n\nThis taxonomy breaks down into twelve motivation factors, grouped into six pairs within three clusters. They are:\n\n- \"Bright\" cluster - immediate fun\n\t- **Action:** Destruction and Excitement\n\t- **Social:** Competition and Community\n- \"Tall\" cluster - cool-headed, long-term fun\n\t- **Mastery:** Challenge and Strategy\n\t- **Achievement:** Completion and Power\n- \"Wide\" cluster - broad, curious, expressive play\n\t- **Immersion:** Fantasy and Story\n\t- **Creativity:** Design and Discovery\n\nThese factors are spectrums. If a person has a low score in one, that doesn't mean indifference, it means a strong preference for the opposite. If you have a high score for Community, it means you prefer to group up and collaborate with other players. If you have a low score, it means you prefer single-player play where you are in full control.\n\nLet's try to break these down.\n\n### Bright Cluster: Action and Socialization\n\nThe **bright** cluster, or action-social cluster, is about short-term gratification. A player who scores high on these motivations craves excitement, either from interacting with other players or the game itself. One who scores low prefer a more calming, controlled experience.\n\nDestruction\n- High: You like guns, explosions, chaos. You might enjoy *Halo*.\n- Low: You like non-violence, calming landscapes, wholesome social interactions. You might enjoy *Myst* or *Animal Crossing*.\n\nExcitement\n- High: You like it when games are fast-paced and filled with action and surprises. You might enjoy *Super Smash Bros. Melee* or *Call of Duty*.\n- Low: You like it when games are calming, turn-based, and can be paused. You prefer low levels of visual stimulation. You might enjoy the *Civilization* series or *The Witness*.\n\nCompetition\n- High: You enjoy comparing yourself to others and playing against a human adversary. You might compete in duels or arena matches, or by leaderboards and time trials. You might enjoy *League of Legends* or *Counter-Strike: Global Offensive*.\n- Low: You enjoy non-adversarial games where you don't have to worry about how you stack up to other players and \"skillful play\" isn't the point. You might enjoy *Dragon Age* or *Gone Home*.\n\nCommunity\n- High: You enjoy teaming up with other people, chatting, and playing in groups. You might group with friends or collaborate with strangers. You may enjoy *Destiny* or *Final Fantasy XIV*.\n- Low: You prefer having full control of your experience and playing in single-player mode. \n\n### Tall Cluster: Mastery and Achievement\n\nThe **tall** cluster, or mastery-achievement cluster, is about long-term satisfaction. A player with high motivations in the tall cluster wants to see things grow over time, to make plans and watch them come to fruition, to keep a cool head as they complete or master a game. A player with low motivations in this cluster might not want to \"wait for the good part\" or prefer to have more immediate control over their experience.\n\nChallenge\n- High: You enjoy games that test your skills, even if they have a steep learning curve. You feel satisfied when you clear a difficult mission or pull off a difficult move. You find the idea of getting better over time to be a powerful motivator. You might enjoy *Street Fighter* or *osu!*\n- Low: You like games that are quick to learn and no sweat to play. You might enjoy *The Longest Journey* or *Stardew Valley*.\n\nStrategy\n- High: You like to contemplate the outcome of your decisions. You enjoy it when games urge you to think and plan out a long-term strategy. You might enjoy *Crusader Kings* or *Stellaris*.\n- Low: You like to act spontaneously and react to your immediate surroundings. You find complex decisions in a game stressful or pointless. You prefer games you can pick up and play for a short time. You might enjoy *Mario Kart* or *The Sims*.\n\nPower\n- High: You like it most when the power of your character grows while you play. You like leveling up characters and stats, upgrading your weapons/powers, and dwarfing the same obstacles that were once an impossible challenge. You might enjoy *Diablo* or *World of Warcraft*.\n- Low: You like it when characters have a fully-developed set of powers from the start. You prefer a level playing field. You might enjoy *Shadow of the Colossus* or *Night in the Woods*.\n\nCompletion\n- High: You prefer to have clear tasks to complete and consistent rewards to collect for completing them. You like it when a game guides you to its next fun activity. You might enjoy *Kingdom Hearts* or *Lego Star Wars*.\n- Low: You prefer to decide what to do for yourself. You like it when a game gives you a sandbox of many possibilities and allows you to pursue your own goals. You might enjoy *Cities: Skylines* or *RimWorld*.\n\n### Wide Cluster: Immersion and Creativity\n\nThe **wide** cluster, or immersion-creativity cluster, is about expressive play. A player who scores high here wants to explore a world, to test the boundaries of the game, to get involved in a story, to express themselves. A low score here means the player prefers things that are concrete, compact, and elegant.\n\nFantasy\n- High: You love it when games have rich lore and an immersive setting. You prefer a photorealistic look or cinematic style. You might enjoy *Mass Effect* or *Fallout*.\n- Low: You find games with retro graphics or abstract settings charming. You don't need any world-building beyond the general vibe of a genre. You might enjoy *World of Tanks*, *Counter-Strike*, or *Marvel vs. Capcom*.\n\nStory\n- High: You like games that have an elaborate narrative structure, with a large cast of characters, each having distinct motivations and personality. You might enjoy *Mass Effect* or *Life is Strange*.\n- Low: You like games without any story getting in the way of the fun. These games might create a simple canvas with stock characters for you to build on. You might enjoy *SimCity*, *Factorio*, or *Minecraft*. \n\nDiscovery\n- High: You like to explore a world to find its secrets and treasure. When you find new objects or characters to interact with, you like to experiment to see how they react to the things you can do. You might enjoy the *Zelda* series or *The Elder Scrolls*.\n- Low: You approach games with a practical mindset. You prefer games you can fully understand with minimal unknown interactions. You might enjoy sports games like *FIFA* or board games like *Carcassonne*.\n\nDesign\n- High: You like to express yourself in the games you play. You enjoy customizing your character's clothes and arranging the decorations in your house. You might enjoy *The Sims*, *Animal Crossing*, or *Guild Wars 2*.\n- Low: You prefer an experience curated by a designer. You enjoy inhabiting a fixed avatar of some stylish or appealing character. You might enjoy *Super Mario Galaxy* or *Horizon Zero Dawn*.\n\n### Applying These\n\nThis gamer motivation model is one way to understand the different reasons various people play video games. You can incorporate it into your vocabulary when explaining or evaluating a game design. You might use it to broaden the game's appeal or focus on the things you expect your players to care about.\n\nIts main limitation is that it is very generalized. It has limited power to describe an individual person's habits (which might apparently contradict themselves) or preferences in the community of a particular game. The number of segments is also arbitrary; there might be applications where more divisions or fewer prove more useful.\n\nFor a more \"pick one\" classification, if you want a drop-in replacement for Bartle types, you might look at the [[Ten Player Profiles]].\n\n\n# Further Reading\n\nMarc LeBlanc's website, discussing the 8 Kinds of Fun and other game design ideas. [http://algorithmancy.8kindsoffun.com/](http://algorithmancy.8kindsoffun.com/ \"http://algorithmancy.8kindsoffun.com/\")\n\nRobin Hunicke and Rubert Zubek wrote an academic paper based on LeBlanc's 8 kinds of fun and the Mechanics/Dynamics/Aesthetics framework. [http://www.cs.northwestern.edu/~hunicke/MDA.pdf](http://www.cs.northwestern.edu/~hunicke/MDA.pdf \"http://www.cs.northwestern.edu/~hunicke/MDA.pdf\")\n\nPresentation summarizing Quantic Foundry's gamer motivation model. \nhttps://quanticfoundry.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Gamer-Motivation-Model-Reference.pdf\n\nAcademic paper describing the same. https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2967934.2967937\n","lastmodified":"2023-11-25T02:57:26.995165927Z","tags":["clean","primer","game-design",""]},"/How-To-Preview-komma-games-quartz":{"title":"How To Preview komma-games-quartz","content":"#meta #quartz-sync \n\n1.

You can also use them for other collaborative writing.\n\n- Listen and respond.\n\t- A great conversation has both *invitations* and *inspirations.*\n\t- An invitation is a statement that directly invites a response, like an open-ended question. They indicate that it is somebody else's turn to talk. They're useful if the scene seems to be slowing, and you need to give it some more structure, but you shouldn't use them too much.\n\t- An inspiration is a statement that shares something, and makes the listener want to share something to, but doesn't obligate them. These statements are useful in improv because your improv partner can respond to them in a variety of ways, or you can continue naturally if they're stumped.\n\t- Listen for inspirations and respond to them to keep the scene going.\n- Yes, and\n\t- React positively to what others are saying\n\t- Build on what is presented instead of merely accepting it\n\t- Don't try to undo new information\n\t- This *does* mean that the players are working together. This does *not* mean that characters won't be in conflict\n\t- Avoid blocking (do not try to \"play it safe\" or minimize the impact of new information)\n\t- Ask yourself \"If this is true, what else is true?\"\n-  avoid asking questions unless you're also adding information. \n\t- unlike in real conversations, leading questions are *great* for improv\n\t- instead of \"Are you ready to go to the Moon?\" try \"Your training is finally going to pay off. We're taking back the Moon.\" or \"Honey, I'm worried. Isn't this the third time you've been to the Moon this month?\"\n\t- instead of \"Is the ship ready to go?\" try \"Did you get rid of those ghost sailors yet?\"\n- Follow your first instinct to maintain momentum\n\t- what comes naturally to you might never have occurred to somebody else\n\t- sometimes things that \"merely make sense\" help the scene feel a little more real ...which makes the comedy funnier\n- Be honest with emotions\n\t- Even in absurd situations, your characters are people and they will have feelings, desires, fears, a history\n\t- Avoid turning them into \"clever writing\" machines\n- Characters must experience some type of change\n\t- Stasis is the everyday; storytelling focuses on the exceptional\n\t- at the minimum, a character will make a choice and experience the ramifications of that choice\n\t- this is true for every scene\n- The Location is Not an Empty Stage\n\t- A scene happens at a place and time\n\t- In stage improv you can establish a place in merely a couple lines of dialog without breaking the scene\n\t- In tabletop RPGs this is partly covered by narration, but players can enhance it with their words too\n- Specifics are the Spice\n\t- (Spice-ifics)\n\t- More detail = more important\n\t- Establishing a detail gives you something to follow up on later in the scene\n\t- Be colorful and very specific\n- Drama and Comedy\n\t- Drama: The easiest way to make a scene dramatic is to focus on the relationship of the characters on stage. Holding tense moments with silence and focusing on each shift in emotions will also emphasize drama.\n\t- Comedy: focus on character's choices, actions, and objects. Make characters double-down on their previous choices and act boldly, larger than life. You can also use irony, miscommunication, wordplay, etc, if they don't break the character.\n\t- In longer form improv, you will want to balance these types of scenes. Too much drama will wear an audience down and get them to put their guard up. Too much comedy will make them see the characters as flat and fake.\n- Focus on the present\n\t- Who is in the scene? What is each of them doing right now? Why did they use that tone, that word, that facial expression? What does your character feel about that?\n\t- If things flow correctly moment to moment, the scene will feel more coherent\n- Be silly, but don't tell jokes\n\t- A joke is a short story consisting of a setup and a punchline, where the funniness culminates in the final sentence.\n\t- *Avoid them at all costs in improv.* For that matter, they're not great for most comedy writing. The climax of the joke kills the momentum of the scene, and its humor rarely derives from the characters involved. It's also hard for other people to build on the joke. Save it for the stand-up comedians.\n\t- Instead, be silly. Deliver your dialog in a funny-sounding way. Adopt peculiar mannerisms or choose odd words. Follow the tips for comedy. This will create a lighthearted, inviting tone that still invites the other players to contribute.\n- Relax and have fun!\n## Further Reading\n\nhttps://www.pantheater.com/rules-of-improv.html\n\nthe Harold method for long-term improv\n","lastmodified":"2023-11-25T02:57:26.995165927Z","tags":[]},"/Indo-European-Language-Family":{"title":"Indo-European Language Family","content":"#languages #quartz-sync \n\n- languages native to the majority of Europe, the Iranian plateau, and the northern Indian subcontinent\n- all descended from a single prehistoric language, Proto-Indo-European, most likely spoken in the Pontic-Caspian steppe (present-day Ukraine and southern Russia)\n- written evidence appeared during the Bronze Age.

There's no strictly scientific way of doing it, but you could try asking the following questions...\n\n**What genre of fiction is it?** Many popular RPGs are in the fantasy genre, set in a fictional world with spells, magical creatures, cursed jewel, and epic adventures. Other games are based on sci-fi, horror, or historical scenarios.\n\n- Fantasy (*Dungeons and Dragons*, *Blades in the Dark*, *Pathfinder*)\n- Science Fiction (*Cyberpunk RED*, *Scum and Villainy*, *Mutant: Year Zero*)\n- Horror (*Call of Cthulhu*, *Alien: The Roleplaying Game*, *Delta Green*)\n- Military / Espionage (*Twilight: 2000*, *FIST: Ultra Edition*, *Never Going Home*)\n- History (*Pendragon*, *Night Witches*)\n- General-Purpose (*Fate*, *GURPS*, *Savage Worlds*)\n\n**How does it treat its rules?** Classic RPGs have well-defined rules about dice rolls, characters sheet, structure of play, conflict resolution, and so on. Other games called \"Storytelling RPGs\" focus on procedures that let the group of players develop a story together. Finally, rules-lite RPGs use simpler rules for pick-up-and-play fun with minimal prep.\n\n- Classic Rules Style (*Lancer*, *Cyberpunk RED*, *Dungeons and Dragons*)\n- Storytelling Rules (*Wanderhome*, *The Quiet Year*, *Monster of the Week*)\n- Rules-lite (*Fiasco*, *Dread*, *Honey Heist*)\n\n\u003e The game's text will tell you how *it* treats its rules, but your experience at the table depends much more on how the GM and players treat the rules.\n\n**What is the style of play?** D\u0026D is designed for campaign play; a long-term style of play where characters develop over time and the narrative gets more complex. Some games are designed primarily for one-shot play, where players can complete a self-contained adventure in a single session.\n\nFurthermore, RPGs are typically cooperative, with players working as a team to overcome obstacles, but there are occasionally ones where players compete against each other, or where players collaborate tell a story about characters opposed to each other.\n\n- Campaign Play (*Dungeons and Dragons*, *FATE*, *Pathfinder*)\n- One-shot Play (*Lasers \u0026 Feelings*, *Fiasco*, *Masks: A New Generation*)\n- Competitive Play (*Paranoia*, *Houses of the Blooded*)","lastmodified":"2023-11-25T02:57:26.995165927Z","tags":[]},"/Koreanic-Language-Family":{"title":"Koreanic Language Family","content":"#languages #quartz-sync \n- Korean and Jeju languages, spoken on the korean peninsula","lastmodified":"2023-11-25T02:57:26.995165927Z","tags":[]},"/Language-App-Price-Chart":{"title":"Language App Price Chart","content":"#fleeting #languages #apps #quartz-sync \n\nUpdated Sep 2023.

If you're excited to get started right now, that's great! Write down the reason you want to learn the language so you can come back to it if you ever feel a slump. Some examples: \n\t- I want to better know a person who speaks this language natively.\n\t- I want to have conversations in this language on social media.\n\t- I want to be able to understand news, videos, or books written in this language.\n\t- I want to travel to a country where this is language is spoken.\n\t- I want to learn new ways of expressing myself.\n\t- I want to master the challenge of a new skill.\n- **Immerse with input.** Listen to the language as much as you can, especially if you can listen to native speakers. Podcasts, YouTube, news streams, foreign TV shows (without English subtitles), that sort of thing. Don't worry if you can't understand much at first. This is basically how you acquired your first language, and is a good complement to more systematic practice.\n- **Talk.** To yourself or to your language-learning partners. Remember, language pre-dates writing. Learning to read and write the language will become easier as you learn to hear and repeat the sounds of the language.\n- **Create.** Use the language in free, creative ways to practice it. Write little conversations, translate the dumbest jokes you can think of, draw a comic, play word association, that sort of thing. You can also use the language to describe things happening to you in real life, like listing the ingredients in a meal.\n- **Learn like a kid.** Play with the language. Be willing to make mistakes. Be ready to drop your previous assumptions about what a language can do. Be okay with things that are ambiguous. Admit that you don't know everything and be willing to ask questions.\n- **Watch and listen.** As you listen to the language, try to imitate it. It *will* sound strange until you have heard it a lot. You can also watch someone's mouth and throat as they're speaking to get a better idea of what happens physically to make these sounds.\n- **Try to find material that is just slightly above your level.** At the start this will be the short simple dialogs you see in language learning textbooks.\n- **Grammar needs examples.** But remember that your goal is to understand the rule, not just memorize the example sentences. Your method for learning grammar will depend on your style and how familiar you are with English grammar. If you're like me, you prefer to learn important rules up front, rather than trying to infer them from examples. Other people might prefer seeing the rule after they know the context where it's used. You don't need to master grammar to get started, but it's worthwhile if you want to become fluent.\n- **It's okay to have a bit of an accent.** Your accent tells a story of who you are, where you came from, and where you've been along the way. It doesn't matter if someone can hear your foreign accent if they can understand what you're trying to say. You should practice your pronunciation, of course, but don't worry if it's not literally perfect.\n- **Don't rely on \"language hacks.\"** Anything that promises to teach you a language in a week is too good to be true. You can't learn anything while sleeping.\n- **Practice every day.**\n\t- Start with a small goal, like ten minutes a day, until it becomes habit. You can study for longer if you feel like it.\n\t- A language learning app (like Duolingo) won't give you everything you need, but it is good at giving you tiny lessons and reminding you when you need to study.\n\t- You should absolutely use spaced repetition flash cards. I recommend [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/). You can create cards yourself or import them from other peoples' decks.","lastmodified":"2023-11-25T02:57:26.995165927Z","tags":[]},"/Mandarin-Chinese":{"title":"Mandarin Chinese","content":"\nIntro\n- [[About the Chinese Language]]\n- [[What Do You Call Chinese]]?\n- [[Should You Learn Traditional Characters or Simplified Characters]]?\n- [[How to Input Chinese on a Computer]]\n- \n\nScript and Sound\n- [[Mandarin Chinese - Phonetics]]\n- [[Mandarin Chinese - Tones]]\n- [[Mandarin Chinese - Writing]]\n\nGrammar\n- [[Mandarin Chinese Grammar - Pointing Stuff Out]]\n\nVocabulary\n- [[Mandarin Chinese - Greetings and Introductions]]\n\nCulture\n\nAppendixes\n- https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Appendix:Table_of_General_Standard_Chinese_Characters - The official standard list of 8,105 Chinese characters published by the PRC government, beginning with 3,500 frequently used characters.\n- http://hanzidb.org/character-list/by-frequency - shows hanzi sorted by frequncy, or by PRC standard order, or by HSK level.\n- https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Translation:List_of_Frequently_Used_Characters_in_Modern_Chinese\n\nMore Resources\n- [Chinese Characters Practice Sheet Generator](https://chinese.gratis/tools/chinese-grid/) for handwriting.\n- [Arch Chinese](https://www.archchinese.com/), a learning platform popular with teachers in the United States.

This is usually the case for non-computerized technology like household appliances, older cars, and farming equipment, but tech with a computer chip inside is practically difficult to repair because the required parts and information aren't being circulated enough.\n\nSome key objectives of the right to repair movement are\n- Giving everyone reasonable access to manuals, schematics, and software updates\n- Make parts and tools needed to service devices available to third parties, including individual buyers, at fair prices\n- Legally allow unlocking and other device modifications so its owner can install custom software\n- Ensuring devices are designed in such a way as to make repair possible\n\nAdvocates of the right to repair argue that these together will lead to consumers favoring repairs over replacement, making the economy more sustainable and reducing the amount of electronic waste. Where these devices are used for work, this also shift the means of production into the hands of workers, which will lead to fairer competition and create a more equitable economy.\n\nAlthough a lot of repair advocates focus on consumer technology, since that affects everybody in some small way, there are also acute needs in areas like\n- computerized farming equipment (John Deer tractors)\n- medical equipment\n- high-tech, computerized versions of cars and home appliances, which are becoming more common\n- and more.\n\n## Rights You Should Know About\n\n- Sites like iFixit sell repair tools and offer documentation for user repair. You can also search YouTube for teardown videos that show off the structure of a device you're trying to repair.\n- The Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act, enacted in 1975, means that the warranty-voiding seals you sometimes see on gadgets are not legally binding. ([The FTC reminds you that a company can't force you to use their own parts to keep the warranty intact.](https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2018/04/ftc-staff-warns-companies-it-illegal-condition-warranty-coverage-use-specified-parts-or-services))\n- There is an exemption in the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) that makes it legal to \"jailbreak\" your devices and run custom software, which means you can extend the life of a device if its manufacturer abandons it.\n- There may be more Right to Repair bills enacted at the state level that assert your rights to repair consumer electronics, automobiles, and farming equipment.\n\n## Further Reading\n\n- https://www.repair.org/\n- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_to_repair\n- https://www.ifixit.com/News/61140/what-is-right-to-repair\n- https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/blog/what-is-right-to-repair/","lastmodified":"2023-11-25T02:57:26.995165927Z","tags":["activism","tech-activism","technology","quartz-sync"]},"/Rules-for-Using-This-Vault":{"title":"Rules for Using This Vault","content":"#quartz-sync #meta\n## 1.

There's no way around the need to recognize and produce the hanzi.\n\nMy personal goal will be to **read and write simplified characters** while being able to read traditional characters as a secondary goal.","lastmodified":"2023-11-25T02:57:26.995165927Z","tags":["languages","chinese","quartz-sync"]},"/Sino-Tibetan-Language-Family":{"title":"Sino-Tibetan Language Family","content":"#languages #quartz-sync \n\n- languages spoken in China, Tibet, Myanmar\n- \"Chinese\" is the Sinitic branch of the family\n    - Standard Chinese, commonly called Mandarin, is the official language of mainland China.

Most often, actions taken by characters within the game succeed or fail according to a formal system of rules and guidelines.\n\nPlay of an RPG typically works like this:\n- A group of people gather for the purpose of playing a particular tabletop RPG.\n- Players determine their roles and create characters as necessary, discussing it along the way.\n\t- Usually, one player takes the role of \"GM\"; the game master, guide, moderator, referee or storyteller. In *Dungeons \u0026 Dragons*, this role is called dungeon master.\n\t- The other players typically have one \"player character\" each.\n- Everybody takes some time to get familiar with the rules necessary to start playing.\n- The GM describes a situation that the player characters are involved in. She asks the players what they want to do.\n- The players describe what the characters say or do in the fiction.  The GM listens: if no game rules apply to this situation, they describe how the situation changes, with an aim towards bringing the players into an exciting or dangerous situation. Otherwise, the GM interprets and applies the rules.\n\t- The GM will usually explain what rules are being applied, so that everything seems fair to the players.\n- The game may switch to procedures for a different mode, like a contest between two characters, a battle, a chase scene, an investigation, or a debate. These are outlined in a game's rules.\n- Players continue as long as they like. Usually this is 2-3 hours, stopping at any natural stopping point or the end of prepared material.\n\nFor a video game metaphor, think Zork, or other interactive fiction. You have a situation described with words and use words to explain what you want to do.\n\nIf you would like to know more about the origin of RPGs, it's covered in the [[History of Games]].\n\nMy notes use the term \"TTRPG\" to distinguish this kind of game from role-playing video games. This doesn't mean a TTRPG must take place around a table, though--they can be played in a voice call, on a virtual canvas, in a text based forum, or a number of other mediums. **The key element is discussion**, not the physical parts.\n## Why would you play one of these when video games exist?\n\nWell, they're something different, and that can be enough. But I think it's important to realize that a tabletop RPG creates quite a different experience than a video game, even if the game is a *Baldur's Gate* or *Solasta: Crown of the Magister* that aims to implement the rules text of a particular tabletop game as closely as it can.\n\n- Because the text and the play of tabletop RPGs are built out of language, and interpreted in whatever way the people at the table agree to, there are way more possibilities for **creative play**. Even in the crunchiest combat-focused games, players will be improvising actions, combining powers in novel ways, or interpreting the consequences of the fight beyond simple scorekeeping.\n- In a video game, you're following a path written by someone else. In a tabletop game, you can **tell the story as you want it**, really inhabit the character you're playing, and leave your own mark on the world.\n- Tabletop RPGs **aren't code, they're ideas**. You can tweak the game you're playing to match what you want it to do without being a professional artist or software engineer. They're run by a group of living, breathing human beings, so it's relatively easy to fix problems and oversights in your games yourself.\n- RPGs have a **thriving independent scene** these days thanks to Internet communities, digital publishing, print-on-demand services, and the ease of tweaking and remixing ideas from other games.\n- Tabletop games are often **easier to learn** and understand than video games, especially to people who aren't frequent gamers. You never have to figure out a confusing user interface or figure out the sequence of buttons that lets you do what you want. You don't need to worry about reflexes or hand-eye coordination. A capable GM can allow players of all abilities to have a fun time together.\n- RPGs are **cooperative, social, and collaborative** by nature. They're a structured way to have conversations with friends. Role-playing is a lot of fun, even when you're doing it badly.\n- If you're playing at a table, it's great to see people face-to-face. You can take a break from the screens that occupy so much else of your life. There's also something really pleasant about rolling dice, flipping through books, jotting down notes, marking things on character sheets, and making maps.\n\n# Further Reading\n\n[How to Get Into Tabletop RPGs! - Shut Up \u0026 Sit Down](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9NtdF51GWE) provides a humorous, encouraging entryway into the hobby.","lastmodified":"2023-11-25T02:57:26.995165927Z","tags":["ttrpg-gaming","primer","",""]},"/TTRPGs-You-Can-Play-For-Free":{"title":"TTRPGs You Can Play For Free","content":"\nThis is a list of tabletop RPGs that you can download (or read online) and start playing for free.

They are:\n- The Acrobat\n- The Gardener\n- The Slayer\n- The Sightseer\n- The Gladiator\n- The Ninja\n- The Bounty Hunter\n- The Architect\n- The Bard\n\n(Tag yourself.)\n\n**The Acrobat** is a solo gamer who primarily wants to take on challenging gameplay, practicing over and over again until they can take on the most difficult missions and bosses. They enjoy games like [[Spelunky]], [[Celeste]], [[Super Metroid]], and [[Tetris]].\n\n**The Gardener** is a gamer looking for quiet, relaxing task completion. They want games where the rules are presented upfront, as directly as possible, and the gameplay itself is spontaneous rather than planned out in advance. The vibes are chill and the beats are lo-fi. They enjoy games like *Candy Crush Saga*, Solitaire, and *Animal Crossing*.\n\n**The Slayer** is a gamer who wants curated cinematic destruction. They feel a rush from chaos and mayhem in the context of a rich game world with an overarching story. They typically enjoy on-rails action-adventure games like *Uncharted* and *Tomb Raider*.\n\n**The Sightseer** is a lot like the Slayer, but with a preference for less violence. Artisanal story experiences like *Firewatch*, *INSIDE*, or Telltale's *The Walking Dead* are favorites of the Sightseer. (This is my own distinction, not mentioned in the QF article.)\n\n**The Skirmisher** wants fast-paced, social action games they can easily pick up and play. They probably enjoy online shooters such as *Call of Duty* or *Counter-Strike*, but don't take the competitive aspects too seriously. They are fine with match-based games where everything resets each match.\n\n**The Gladiator** is a self-described \"hardcore\" gamer who wants an experience that's truly epic. Their ideal game has a broad spectrum of features including: power progression, team arenas, fast-paced play, challenges that require strategic thinking, and a rich world with tons of lore. They often enjoy games like *Destiny*, *Gears of War*, *Monster Hunter*, or *Black Desert Online*.\n\n**The Ninja** is a gamer who wants to take on difficult challenges that also involve strategic decision making, fast-paced play, and competition. They don't care as much about in-game progression as they do skill-based mastery and their own accomplishments. They might play games like *StarCraft*, *Street Fighter*, *Super Smash Brothers*, *osu!*, or *League of Legends*.\n\n**The Bounty Hunter** wants an open game world that they can make their own. They want to explore stuff, build stuff, and power up their characters in the context of the world. Popular games for the Bounty Hunter include *Saints Row*, *Mass Effect*, *Far Cry*, *The Elder Scrolls*, and *Fallout*.\n\n**The Architect** wants planning and decision-making that leads to progression and task completion, often in a game with an interesting setting or story. Maybe you are putting together a functional craft economy on Mars, playing politics in a medieval monarchy, or figuring out just the right combination of abilities and party members to exorcise the wretched sea ghosts from the pirates' den. The Architect strongly prefers solo gameplay with games that are slow-paced, relaxing, or serene. They often play games like *Civilization*, *Europa Universalis*, *Banished*, or *Pillars of Eternity*.\n\n**The Bard** is a social gamer who wants to chat and interact with other players in game worlds that are rich with lore, stories, discovery, and customization. They care little about power progression and task completion. They just want to experience the game world organically. Their popular games include titles like *The Secret World*, *Final Fantasy XIV*, and *Animal Crossing*.\n\n(Games for the Bard are usually multiplayer, but games that have a big emphasis on sharing your own creations or participating in an online fandom are also appealing to the Bard.)\n\n## Limitations\n\n**There isn't a one-size-fits-all player segment model that works for every situation.**\n\nThe player profiles we describe here are more like paint colors you can mix together than separate buckets. This segment model provides a broad taxonomy for gamers as a whole, but they read like caricatures of genres—you lose nuance and granularity when you try to segment all gamers. If you're making an Open World Action-Adventure game then the largest block of players in your audience will be Bounty Hunters—but so what? You probably already knew that. You will need more data if you're working within a specific genre or a specific game title. They suggest working with just a sample of players who care about your genre or franchise.\n\n## Further Reading\n\nhttps://quanticfoundry.com/2020/08/17/player-segments/","lastmodified":"2023-11-25T02:57:26.995165927Z","tags":["atom","reference","learning","game-design",""]},"/Therianthropy":{"title":"Therianthropy","content":"\nA **therian** is an individual who identifies as or feels like they are a non-human animal in a non-biological sense. This might be because of some aspect of spirituality or psychology, but that's not a defining characteristic--as long as a person's sense of self is being that of a non-human animal. The animal the individual identifies with is called their *theriotype*.\n\n(*Otherkin* is a related term, typically used by one that identifies as a mythical or imaginary species, like a dragon, fairy, or elf.)\n\nThe r/Therian subreddit offers a further definition of the term.\n- therians are physically human and understand that they have human bodies\n- therian may experience urges or sensations that they feel they can best explain as a feeling of not being fully human. \n- often associated with feelings of sadness or anxiety when the therian realizes they are not the species of their theriotype\n- it is not related to religious practice\n- it is a label for life experiences, not a voluntary practice. (You wouldn't typically, like, go to \"therian church\", or spend an hour each week in therian meditation, etc.)\n- identifying **as** an animal, not identifying **with** an animal\n\nSome therians use the shorthand **ΔΘ** (delta theta) to identify themselves to others on social media. Therianthropy is [[Identify a Cult with BITE|not a cult]]; most therian communities I've seen encourage independent inquiry.\n\nA 2017 [survey conducted by Furscience](https://furscience.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Fur-Science-Final-pdf-for-Website_2017_10_18.pdf) asked participants to check off any terms that they apply to them, without imposing a particular definition. About 11-17% of the furry fandom identify themselves as therian, and therians identify significantly more strongly with their favorite animal species than furries do. Therians are much more likely to say they feel less than 100% human. This suggests a dramatic difference between therians and non-therian furries. Of the people who say they feel less than 100% human, it is more common to describe it as a mental feeling than a physical feeling.\n\n# Am I a therian?\n\nThe author of this note is not a therian. I am a human with a human body and I value the simplicity of that explanation.\n\nIf you think you might be a therian, consider the following:\n- Nobody other than you can tell you.\n\t- Similarly, you can't look at a person on social media and tell whether they are \"truly therian\" or \"just saying they are.\" People can write about their experiences but can also write fiction. Maybe some people just want to feel like they're part of a club. There's really no scientific distinction.\n- There are only two questions you need to answer \"yes\" to:\n\t- Do you have non-human animal experiences?\n\t- Does it feel more authentic for you to say \"I consider myself (species)\" rather than \"I consider myself just human\"?\n- If you are therian, nobody other than you can tell you what your theriotype is. You should learn about the animals in the world around you to see what resonates with you.\n- You don't need to do special vocalizations, exercise on all fours, have lots of outdoor hobbies, or dress up with animal accessories (\"gear\") to call yourself a therian. You also don't have to call yourself a therian just because you do those things.\n\n# Therian concerns\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/Therian/comments/h890rc/some_advice_from_an_adult_therian/ - This post is from a 30 year old therian who is employed, married, not depressed, etc. Cool.\n\nThey give some advice that focuses mostly on how to moderate certain therian behaviors. There's no reason to think therians act the same way or feel the same urges, but it's an interesting read. Some advice they give:\n\n- Do small \"animal\" things regularly to avoid a build-up of frustration, like playing with pets, going outdoors, or walking around on all fours at home when no one can see you.\n- Keep your human side safe and don't do anything dangerous or stupid.\n\t- Don't eat raw meat, wild mushrooms, unknown berries, etc.\n\t- Don't get in fights.\n\t- Don't jump off of really high places.\n\t- Don't test your balance in places where falling would really hurt.\n- It's OK to hide therianthropy behind being a furry fan or into cosplay (things that are more socially acceptable) than to be open about the spiritual/psychological belief. Presumably because you wouldn't be open about spiritual matters with people who aren't close friends anyway.\n- Don't isolate yourself from society; participate in life and be a good person.\n- Don't ignore perfectly nice non-therian friends.\n- Don't be afraid to discuss therianthropy with a therapist; it's not a problem that needs treatment. Depression, anxiety, and social isolation are things that can be treated. You will only get \"locked up\" if you are risk of harming yourself or others, not for being seen as weird.\n- Don't think about therianthropy too much. It's only one part of who you are. It's also totally fine if you think you are a therian for a while and later realize a different word fits your experience better.\n\nSome people on [r/asktransgender offer thoughts](https://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/4fwcfr/what_are_yalls_opinions_on_otherkintherians/):\n\n- \"I think that as long as they're identifying as otherkin in a way that isn't mocking trans folk it's totally fine.\" -crystxlize\n- \"I don't understand it, but that doesn't mean that it's not real.\" -inkwat\n- paraphrased: \"I feel like it's similar to furries, which in itself is not a bad thing. But when someone says 'if you can be a woman then I should be able to be a dragon', I do think it mocks trans people.\" -Wildernessinabox\n- \"I'm friends with a small number of therians and I must say the crazies you sometimes see on tumblr aren't a representative sample by any means. ...To \\[the therians I've known], it's simply a preferred interpretation of some rather unique life experiences.\" - zeanoth \n\n# Therianthropy in VR\n\nSome people use avatars of anthropomorphic furry characters or non-human animals in VRChat. Because avatars are capable of mimicking the player's head and hand movements (if they have the appropriate motion trackers), as well as lip syncing, blinking, and eye tracking, some therians feel it allows them to better connect with their theriotype. However, I haven't been able to find a good thread of theirians explaining their thoughts on the platform quite yet. \n\n# Further Reading\n\nhttps://furscience.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Fur-Science-Final-pdf-for-Website_2017_10_18.pdf\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therianthropy#Modern_therianthropy\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/Therian/comments/h890rc/some_advice_from_an_adult_therian/","lastmodified":"2023-11-25T02:57:26.995165927Z","tags":[]},"/Timmy-Johnny-and-Spike":{"title":"Timmy, Johnny, and Spike","content":"\nMark Rosewater is an American game designer best known for being the head designer for the collectible card game *Magic: The Gathering*, a position he's held since 2003. He writes a column called \"Making Magic\" where he gives a behind-the-scenes look on how *Magic* cards are made. Around 2002, he wrote an article titled \"Timmy, Johnny, and Spike\", in which he explained three psychographic profiles that Wizards of the Coast uses when developing their products. If their goal is to make \"something for everybody\", then these are the \"everybodies\" they have in mind.\n\n(By the way, a psychographic profile is just a fancy term for saying \"let's apply statistics to our market research to put them into convenient groups.\")\n\nA **Timmy** (or **Tammy**) is a player who wants to play socially or \"for fun.\" They like to use cards with big, impressive effects. They aren't too worried about winning or losing. You can compare them to [Bartle](Bartle%20Taxonomy.md)'s Socializers.\n\nA **Johnny/Jenny** is a player who wants to build complex and creative decks as an exercise in self-expression. They want to use cards with unusual interactions or combos, or come up with ways to make \"useless\" cards work for them. They want to win, but only if they can win with style. You might compare these to Bartle's Explorers, or at least the aspect that wants to analyze and manipulate game mechanics.\n\nA **Spike** is a player motivated by the spirit of competition. They want to become a stronger player, prove how good they are, and outplay their opponents. They focus on trying to win by any means necessary (within the bounds of the game; Spikes aren't usually cheaters), even if it means relying on decks or strategies developed by others. The push for victory is what gives them the most mental stimulation. You can compare Spikes to Bartle's Killers.\n\nAs with all player classifications, individuals are too complex to fit completely into one of these boxes, but they can be helpful goalposts for design.\n\nWhere do Bartle's Diamonds fit in? Well, the nature of *Magic* is that you play a game for ten minutes to an hour, then everything resets. There's no way to accumulate points, complete quests, accrue new spells, and so on just from playing. This is a good example of how analyzing player types from looking at a single game might be misleading.\n\nOver the years, this trio has been extended with a separate \"aesthetic profile\" to describe what a player appreciates about *Magic* even when they aren't playing it. The first of these is **Mel**, a player who thinks cards with interesting rules interactions are beautiful, who might call things \"elegant\" or \"well-designed\" as a term of endearment. The second is **Vorthos** (first described by *Magic* artist Matt Cavotta), a player invested in the lore of the *Magic* world, someone who thinks a card with strong flavor and creative consistency is beautiful. These both roughly correspond to Bartle's Explorer type, but I think that comparison just reveals that we need a larger vocabulary to talk about this stuff.\n\nIt's good to be familiar with these terms Timmy/Tammy, Johnny/Jenny, and Spike because they often come up in discussions about multiplayer, competitive games. However, it's important to remember that they are also the product of one company's market research, rather than any peer-reviewed academic consensus, and the scope of their application may be as limited as \"why this person buys *Magic: The Gathering* products\".\n\n## Further Reading\n\nhttps://mtg.fandom.com/wiki/Player_type\n\nhttps://magic.wizards.com/en/news/making-magic/timmy-johnny-and-spike-2013-12-03\n\n\n\"against timmy, johnny, and spike\", one *Magic* player's perspective against the common classifications.

The political atmosphere in countries like the United States and the United Kingdom makes it tough for these people to feel like they have the support, the rights, and the medical care they need to thrive. I'm speaking up to spread awareness of how you can be a better ally to the transgender people in your life.\n\n## Easy Tips for Allies\n\n- Know that there is no one way to be a 'perfect' ally. Accept that you will sometimes make mistakes, but if you do your best, stay respectful, and are ready to listen, you'll stay on the right path.\n- You don't have to understand someone's identity to respect it. All people deserve respect.\n- You can't \"just know\" if someone is trans by looking at them or listening to the way they talk. There is no one way for transgender people to look. It's possible that there are trans people alongside you in line at the Subway, or watching movies with you at the theater. You might never know and that's *fine*.\n- Speak out in support of transgender people and transgender rights! Being an outspoken ally makes the social spaces you inhabit safer for trans people, even if you don't know of any trans people there. Politely correct others if they use the wrong name or pronoun for a transgender person.\n- There is no \"one right way\" to be transgender. Some trans people change their legal names, and some don't. Some change aspects of their appearance like clothing and hair, and some don't. Some people chose to medically transition, and some don't. It doesn't matter what things a trans person has or hasn't done to transition; a trans man is still a man, and a trans woman is still a woman.\n- Use the language a transgender person uses for themselves.\n- If you don't know what pronouns to use, just ask. If you still feel unsure, share your own pronouns first. \"Hi, I'm Komma, and I use he/him/his as my pronouns. How about you?\" Don't make a big deal out of a pronoun mistake; just apologize and move on.\n- Be careful and considerate about what other questions you ask. You should probably **avoid** these kinds of questions unless you are very close to the trans person:\n\t- What is your birth name? (And you should never call it their \"real\" name!)\n\t- Do you have photographs from before you transitioned?\n\t- What hormones are you taking?\n\t- What surgeries have you had?\n\t- ...or any question about sexual relationships.\n- Someone's transgender identity is *their* private information. Just because someone has told you about their identity does not necessarily mean they have told everyone in their life. Maybe they're worried about being mistreated by their family, or fired from their job, or simply not ready for the emotional labor of coming out to everyone. Err on the side of privacy.\n- Avoid compliments or adviced based on stereotypes about how men or women should look/act, or stereotypes about transgender people. These can be hurtful, even if they are said with good intentions. **Avoid** comments like the following:\n\t- \"You look like a real woman!\"\n\t- \"I never would have known that you're trans.\"\n\t- \"You would look less trans if you wore more makeup.\"\n\t- \"No real man would wear that jacket. You should change if you don't want people to know you're transgender.\"\n\t- \"I'd date him, even though he's transgender.\"\n- Think about how you use gendered language. Many transgender people are fine being called 'ladies' and 'gentlemen', but you can't know without first asking. There are a variety of ways you can change your habits and practice nongendered language. Some examples:\n\t- \"Hey folks\" instead of \"Hey guys\"\n\t- \"Esteemed guests\" or \"everyone\" instead of \"ladies and gentlemen\"\n\t- \"To whom it may concern\" instead of \"Dear sir or madam\"\n\t- \"Salesperson\" instead of \"salesman\"\n\t- \"Legislator\" instead of \"congressman\"\n\t- \"Performer\" instead of \"actor/actress\"\n\t- \"Toughen up\" instead of \"man up\"\n- On forms and documents, consider whether you need to include gender at all. How will that information be used? If you do need to ask for it, use a blank space for people to fill in as they feel comfortable, rather than boxes marked \"male\" and \"female\".\n- Push to allow people to use bathrooms and other facilities in a way that matches their gender identity rather than what's on their government-issued ID. In particular, a single-occupant restroom should have a sign that just says \"restroom\".\n- Seek out education yourself in addition to the conversations you have with the trans people in your life.\n\n## Further Reading\n\n[National Center for Transgender Equality](https://transequality.org/issues/resources/supporting-the-transgender-people-in-your-life-a-guide-to-being-a-good-ally)","lastmodified":"2023-11-25T02:57:26.995165927Z","tags":["rough"]},"/Turkic-Language-Family":{"title":"Turkic Language Family","content":"#languages #quartz-sync \n- language family spoken by Turkic peoples of Eurasia, from Eastern Europe to Southern Europe to Central Asia, East Asia, Siberia, and Western Asia\n- originated in a region spanning from Mongolia to Northwest China\n- includes Turkish, Uzbek, Azerbaijani, Uyghur, and many more\n- some linguists have suggested a genetic relation between Turkic and Korean, but the idea of grouping the Turkic, Mongolic, and Tungusic language families, possibly with Japonic and Koreanic, is not a mainstream linguistic view.","lastmodified":"2023-11-25T02:57:26.995165927Z","tags":[]},"/Typing-Superscripts":{"title":"Typing Superscripts","content":"#quartz-sync \n\nIn obsidian: use the `\u003csup\u003e` HTML tag.\n\nIn Anki\n1. click the button or use the \\[Ctrl + Shift + =\\] keyboard shortcut, or\n2. enable source view and add the `\u003csup\u003e` there.\n","lastmodified":"2023-11-25T02:57:26.995165927Z","tags":[]},"/What-Do-You-Call-Chinese":{"title":"What Do You Call Chinese","content":"**In short, it depends.** When I say \"Chinese\" or \"Mandarin Chinese\", I'm referring to the modern, standardized form of Mandarin Chinese; the same one that's used in the United Nations.\n\nThe full term is:\n\n|           |                        |\n| --------- | ---------------------- |\n| trad.     | 現代標準漢語           |\n| simp.     | **现代标准汉语**           |\n| pinyin    | xiàndài biāozhǔn hànyǔ |\n| literally | modern (现代) standard (标准) Han speech (汉语)                       |\n\n...but this isn't what you would call it in everyday conversation.\n\nChinese speakers in mainland China call it 普通話 / **普通话** = _Pǔtōnghuà_ = common speech.\n\nChinese speakers in Taiwan call it  國語 / **国语** = _Guóyǔ_ = national language.\n\nChinese speakers in Malaysia call it 華語 / **华语** = _Huáyǔ_ = Hua (Chinese) language.\n\nBut the most general term for spoken Chinese is 漢語 / **汉语** = _Hànyǔ_ = Han speech.
