{"/":{"title":"Komma Games Notebook","content":"\n[Markdown DataTable example](private/Markdown%20DataTable%20example.md)\n\nWelcome! I'm Kevin, but online people mostly call me Komma Chameleon. This website is an open notebook; a digital garden of my research and thoughts on subjects like writing, history, nature, foreign languages, and games of all kinds. My goal is to build up a public body of knowledge that anybody can wander through.\n\n## Where to start?\n\n- [[About Me]]\n- The [#best](tags/best) posts\n- Learn about my [[Game Reviews and Recommendations]]\n- Check out my [[Projects]]\n- Enjoy gaming in a variety of formats: [[Video Gaming]], [[Board Gaming]], and [[TTRPG Gaming]] \n- [#essays](tags/essays) comprising significant thoughts\n- My gamedev/writing [[Worldbuilding]]\n- My [[Learning]] of various subjects\n- [[Programming]] and game development notes\n- My niche [[Furry]] content\n- Posts by status: [#rough](tags/rough), [#clean](tags/clean), or [#polished](tags/polished)\n- ...or pick a recently updated note from the list at the bottom of this page!\n\n## What you should expect\n\n**I might be wrong.** This notebook is an act of learning and creating in public. It may occassionally contain factual errors, misleading phrases, or omit critical context. Please don't hold this against me. We're all learners! I encourage you to refer to multiple sources about anything important.\n\nI am **explicitly inviting you to criticise my work.** Every page in here is a living document. You can reach me at any of the social media links included in the footer on each page. (Telegram works best.) I will do my best to act on feedback and correct my notes.

If I talk negatively about a game, an idea, or a project, I will try to limit that to the *work*, not the people who worked on it or said it. I will strive to treat others the way they want to be treated.\n\n**I will provide personal context for beliefs and notes.** I'll let you know what degree of experience I have in the topic, how strongly I hold a belief, and link out to resources where you can learn more. In line with this goal, I've adopted these tags:\n\n- *#rough* for early, rough ideas.\n- *#clean* for something cleaned up and clarified.\n- *#polished* for something reasonably complete, but that still gets occasional updates.\n\n**I will make fictional contexts clear** when I'm discussing a detail of a fictional property or my own worldbuilding. I do not want anybody to get confused between fiction and reality.\n\n**No filler text** generated by an AI language model or similar tool. I aim to be authentically human, acne and all.\n\n**I will try to reward feedback, but can't promise to agree or respond to all of it.** I ultimately run this website for my own benefit, so I will not beg for views or feedback. I will listen to feedback and correct things I get wrong as soon as I can. However, I don't write with the rigor of an academic.","lastmodified":"2023-04-17T21:32:41.594932417Z","tags":[]},"/About-Me":{"title":"About Me","content":"\nI'm Kevin, known online mostly by my alias Komma Chameleon. I am a millennial born and raised in the southeast United States. (I don't always love it, but I don't have any plans to leave, either.) My educational background is in computer science (Georgia Tech, 2012) but my interests also include foreign languages, history, nature, writing, and games of every sort. What I want to do is bring ideas from my head into reality, to make the world a better place than it was when I found it, and to help the good people of the world treat each other with a little bit more calm and kindness.\n\nI am an asexual cisgender man (though somewhat of an androphile) and support all members of the LGBTQIA+ community. I wish to say in no uncertain terms that trans men are men, trans women are women, and [[Trans Rights Are Human Rights]], and additionally that Black lives matter. I have also been a member of the furry fandom for the better part of two decades, and for all its ups and downs it has been a constant source of friendship, inspiration, and challenging ideas in my life. My [[fursona]] is an anthropomorphic chameleon who gives very good hugs.\n\nI think something I value most is authenticity. I want to be mindful of my experiences in life, how my own acts and thoughts have shaped them, and the extent to which I allow myself to be shaped by them. I must be true to myself, truthful to others, and dishonest never. By being authentic, I can exercise kindness in everything I do, without getting stuck on some ulterior motivation. Along with this, I embrace creativity in artistic expression and problem solving. I process information critically and keep my mind open to other possibilities. While it can be exhausting, I love to learn, and I am eager to understand what new kinds of beauty exist in the world.\n\nIn terms of technical skills, my favorite [programming](#programming) languages are C#, TypeScript, and Python. The toolbox also includes JavaScript, C, C++, Java, Lua, and a touch of Rust, Kotlin, and Objective-C. (I prefer TypeScript over JavaScript and Kotlin over Java whenever possible.) I have worked on games in Godot, Unity, Cocos2D-X, and CreateJS, and deployed them to platforms including the iOS App Store and the mobile web, with game prototypes playable on all major desktop operating systems. I have some exposure to emscripten. Markdown is my preferred syntax for blogging and note-taking, typically alongside Joplin (my old fave) or Obsidian (my new fave), although I am comfortable with HTML, CSS, and JSON blobs as well. I am a confident writer and my peers have often complimented my project organization skills. Other people trust me for my technical advice.\n\nIt is no secret that [I am a fan of video games](Game Recommendations). I grew up playing the likes of *Commander Keen* and *Lemmings* alongside classic entries in the Nintendo catalog, and continue to keep up with the industry's biggest surprises and independent hits. I also adore the design sense of modern board games like *Root* and *Race for the Galaxy*, and have a harmless obsession with reading through tabletop RPG books and daydreaming about all the possible adventures they promise. (Alas, few are able to slay that dread beast, Scheduling.) With the advent of streaming video, my interest in Japanese video games bloomed into an appreciation for all kinds of international media. I count *The Diving Bell and the Butterfly* and *Portrait of a Lady on Fire* among my favorite films alongside *Princess Mononoke* and just-plain-fun series like *Death Note*.","lastmodified":"2023-04-17T21:32:41.590932366Z","tags":["","best"]},"/Bartle-Taxonomy":{"title":"Bartle Taxonomy","content":"\n1996 paper by Richard Bartle focused on MMO players\n\nquadrant model: x axis is interacting with world vs interacting with players, y axis is acting on things unilaterally vs interacting with things\n\n- Achievers/Diamonds want to gain concrete measure of success: points, levels, equipment\n- Explorers/Spades want to travel around, solve puzzles, find secrets, immerse themselves in the game world\n- Socializers/Hearts want to socialize with other players\n- Killers/Clubs want to get high scores, cause mayhem, best other players in friendly (or unfriendly) competition\n\nsort of a typology; a single player can fit into multiple categories to varying degrees\n\ngood starting point, still frequently referenced, but focus on one type of game makes it quite incomplete\n\nother big problem: Explorer type didn't appear in later research, and suggested sub-factors of Explorer type (geographical exploration and analyzing game mechanics) were not correlated \n\n## Further Reading\n\nThe obligatory Wikipedia link. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bartle_taxonomy_of_player_types\n\nRichard Bartle, 1996. \"Hearts, Clubs, Diamonds, Spades: Players Who Suit Muds\". https://mud.co.uk/richard/hcds.htm\n\nWho plays, how much, and why?

Fun. Fun for everyone! -Satoru Iwata\n\nSuppose you're a game designer. You have made it your objective to create a game and make it fun. Perhaps you've taken inspiration from the late Nintendo president Satoru Iwata. Maybe it's because you're a working professional, and you believe that a game that's more fun will sell better. (It certainly has to be \"fun enough\"!) Or maybe you're an artist, or a hobbyist with a loftier goal: doing what you can to make the human experience a little bit better by creating that elusive feeling of fun. There's just one problem.\n\nWhat is \"fun\"?\n\nOne way to answer the question is to be as literal as possible. Fun entails a physiological response. It is a perception of novelty that stimulates the brain into releasing a communication chemical (or *neurotransmitter*) called dopamine. The dopamine stimulates the amygdala, a cluster of the brain that processes memory and emotions. Fun is something that tells your brain to create a pleasant feeling, and associate that feeling with the memory of the fun activity.\n\nTo the creator of art, this is somewhat helpful to know. There are a million ways to stimulate the brain, and fun could be a part of any one of them. If we think about the word \"fun\" itself, it describes something pleasant, personal, yet unpredictable. If you repeat something fun too often, it stops being fun; watch your favorite movie three times in a row to see how. A strong focus on goals and external rewards can turn a fun activity into a job. It is the nature of fun to defy easy definition.\n\nI propose this: let's flip the question on its head. Instead of saying \"People want games that are fun. What is fun?\" let's say \"Fun is the thing the players want. What do they want?\" Why does a person play games? What motivates them to come back to the hobby, time and again? There are a couple older models worth mentioning, like the [[Bartle Taxonomy]] and \"[[Timmy, Johnny, and Spike]],\" but I want to focus on Marc LeBlanc's \"Eight Kinds of Fun\" and the \"Gamer Motivation Model\" developed by the market research company Quantic Foundry.\n\n## Eight Kinds of Fun\n\nGame designer and educator Marc LeBlanc proposed the following non-exhaustive list to explain the different kinds of fun.\n\n1. Sensation: sense-pleasure\n2. Fantasy: make-believe\n3. Narrative: story\n4. Challenge: obstacle course\n5. Fellowship: social framework\n6. Discovery: uncharted territory\n7. Expression: self-discovery\n8. Submission: pastime\n\nYou can see these explained in context in [Hunickle, LeBlanc, Zubek (2004)](http://www.cs.northwestern.edu/~hunicke/pubs/MDA.pdf). This paper explains something called the *MDA framework*, a formal way of looking at how people take in game artifacts. In simplest terms, a designer implements Mechanics (rules) that interact to create Dynamics (a system) that evoke in the player certain Aesthetics (desirable emotional responses, \"fun\").\n\n(This use of the word \"aesthetics\" is different from its common use, where it refers to something's visual style.)\n\nTo a game designer, **fun is a desirable emotional response; any feeling that motivates play.** It could be one of these eight kinds, or something totally different. It might even include some negative emotion to accentuate a positive, like fear leading to excitement, frustration leading to satisfaction, or sadness leading to catharsis.\n\nLet's break each of these down further.\n\n1. **Sensation**. The game as sense-pleasure. The game is a joy to touch. It is so pretty to look at and pleasant to listen to that a player can't help but smile.\n2. **Fantasy**. The game as make-believe. This means you're able to play a role you're not able to in real life, like a dragon-slaying heroine, a fast-driving outlaw, or the mayor of a village of animals.\n3. **Narrative**. The game as an unfolding story. This might be drama you witness, where your game interactions connect you with the world and characters. Or, it might be a plotline that changes depending on your play.\n4. **Challenge**. The game as an obstacle course. This kind of fun is the satisfaction you get from overcoming an arbitrary hurdle. Note that this isn't synonymous with difficulty. A designer doesn't always need to give players failure to challenge them.\n5. **Fellowship**. The game as a social framework. As designers, we can express this as *Cooperation* or *Competition*. In cooperative fellowship, players work together as a group to achieve a goal in the game. In competitive fellowship, players agree to compete, so they may pursue the pleasure of besting another real human being. Fellowship might also mean chatting and interacting with other people through an avatar.\n6. **Discovery**. The game as uncharted territory. It's fun to see new things, explore new places, and analyze the intricacies of a game system.\n7. **Expression**. These are games that let you express some aspect of yourself. You might build structures, design outfits, act out a character's personality, or execute a plan of your own invention.\n8. **Submission**. The game as a mindless pastime. This word might sound scary, like you're surrendering your free will to a machine. It shouldn't! In the human experience, it can be very helpful to have something to help pass the time while your mind focuses elsewhere. Some people will enjoy a phone puzzle to pass fifteen minutes while waiting for the bus. At other times, people crave a massive adventure where they can spend hours completing tasks when they are too tired to do anything else.\n\nI personally find that a game can be best described as focusing on two to four kinds of fun. This doesn't mean they are absent of the other kinds of fun; just that they aren't the focus. Also remember that this taxonomy is non-exhaustive. There might be other kinds of fun--other desirable emotional responses--that aren't covered by these eight. You might also consider ones that are more specific; you might distinguish between *narrative* filled with jokes and *narrative* filled with political intrigue.\n\nDifferent kinds of fun may come at odds with each other during the design process. For example, increasing the costs of a player's powerful wizard spells might make the game a more satisfying Challenge. The same design choice will hurt the Fantasy of being a powerful magician. For a second example, lavish visuals and prominent music may add to a game's Sensation pleasures. Yet that change may reduce the clarity needed for competitors to find Fellowship. You should try to understand which kinds of fun your experience keeps in focus in order to weigh the trade-offs and make better design choices.\n\n### Examples\n\nTo better understand fun, let's take a look at some popular video games and board games and ask what aesthetics they appeal to.\n\n- *Super Mario Brothers* is about:\n\t- the Challenge of helping Mario run and jump safely from the start of one level to the next, \n\t- the Sensation of his expertly-tuned physics and chipper sound effects, and \n\t- the Discovery of the tricks and secrets hidden in every level.\n- *Tetris Effect* appeals to Sensation with its interactive music and spectacular backgrounds. It appeals to Submission with its simple rules, variety of difficulty levels, and endless challenge modes.\n- *Red Dead Redemption 2* appeals to:\n\t- the Fantasy of being a cowboy outlaw, \n\t- the Discovery of the landmarks and sights of the wild west, and \n\t- the Narrative of Arthur Morgan's dramatic quest for survival.\n- *Earthbound* has:\n\t- a strange, sentimental Narrative about psychic kids trying to stop a covert invasion of space aliens, with \n\t- the Sensation of its poppy sample-based soundtrack and \n\t- the Discovery of its distinct towns, funny enemies, and exotic destinations.\n- *Pandemic* is a board game where a Fellowship of friends cooperate to win or lose. They engage with the Fantasy of being a team of medical experts tasked with eradicating a global pandemic. Players must overcome the game's considerable strategic Challenge by thinking together.\n- Key to *Magic the Gathering* is the Discovery of countless card combinations that players can build into personalized decks. A player might try to make their deck strong or fill it with amusing shenanigans. Some players seek the game's Competitive Fellowship, honing their tactics and deck construction. Others see their decks as an opportunity for self-Expression by picking the mana colors and card themes they enjoy the most.\n- *Minecraft* is an open-ended sandbox often played for Fellowship in a tight community of players. Each player may choose a different goal, depending on what they find fun. Some may seek Expression by gathering the materials needed to build elaborate homes. Some may try to Discover the world's natural wonders, villages, or underground resource deposits. Others might enjoy hanging out.\n- The *Diablo* games are action RPGs ideal for Submission. Treasure is plentiful. Character upgrades are frequent but not always predictable. Objectives, usually wiping a bunch of demons and undead, are clear and satisfying. Diablo's cooperative play supports Fellowship. Its elite monsters and unlockable difficulty levels create Challenge. The variety of playable character archetypes help players fulfill the Fantasy; each can be their favorite kind of gothic hero.\n\nTry analyzing one of your favorite games using these ideas. What kinds of fun does it favor? How might you change the game if you wanted to emphasize a different kind of fun? Using *Super Mario Brothers* as an example, you could make it a better tool of Expression by including a level editor and allowing players to share their creations with others, and allowing players to unlock more building blocks for their own levels by clearing associated challenges in the game's platforming mode. A team of designers did exactly this when creating *Mario Maker*.\n\n## Quantic Foundry gamer motivation model from Yee and Ducheneaut\n\nQuantic Foundry is a video game analytics/marketing research firm. They used data science and a massive amount of survey data (collected from the [gamer motivation profile](https://apps.quanticfoundry.com/surveys/start/gamerprofile/) survey, which you can take for free online) to create the \"Gamer Motivation Model\"; an attempt to describe why people play games and the different preferences of those gamers. This model was developed by the company's co-founders, Nick Yee and Nicolas Ducheneaut, both scientists with academic backgrounds. If you want to know more about their methods, this [2016 GDC Talk](https://quanticfoundry.com/2016/04/07/gdc-talk/) might be illuminating, but if you just want the bottom line, keep reading.\n\nThis taxonomy breaks down into twelve motivation factors, grouped into six pairs within three clusters. They are:\n\n- \"Bright\" cluster - immediate fun\n\t- **Action:** Destruction and Excitement\n\t- **Social:** Competition and Community\n- \"Tall\" cluster - cool-headed, long-term fun\n\t- **Mastery:** Challenge and Strategy\n\t- **Achievement:** Completion and Power\n- \"Wide\" cluster - broad, curious, expressive play\n\t- **Immersion:** Fantasy and Story\n\t- **Creativity:** Design and Discovery\n\nThese factors are spectrums. If a person has a low score in one, that doesn't mean indifference, it means a strong preference for the opposite. If you have a high score for Community, it means you prefer to group up and collaborate with other players. If you have a low score, it means you prefer single-player play where you are in full control.\n\nLet's try to break these down.\n\n### Bright Cluster: Action and Socialization\n\nThe **bright** cluster, or action-social cluster, is about short-term gratification. A player who scores high on these motivations craves excitement, either from interacting with other players or the game itself. One who scores low prefer a more calming, controlled experience.\n\nDestruction\n- High: You like guns, explosions, chaos. You might enjoy *Halo*.\n- Low: You like non-violence, calming landscapes, wholesome social interactions. You might enjoy *Myst* or *Animal Crossing*.\n\nExcitement\n- High: You like it when games are fast-paced and filled with action and surprises. You might enjoy *Super Smash Bros. Melee* or *Call of Duty*.\n- Low: You like it when games are calming, turn-based, and can be paused. You prefer low levels of visual stimulation. You might enjoy the *Civilization* series or *The Witness*.\n\nCompetition\n- High: You enjoy comparing yourself to others and playing against a human adversary. You might compete in duels or arena matches, or by leaderboards and time trials. You might enjoy *League of Legends* or *Counter-Strike: Global Offensive*.\n- Low: You enjoy non-adversarial games where you don't have to worry about how you stack up to other players and \"skillful play\" isn't the point. You might enjoy *Dragon Age* or *Gone Home*.\n\nCommunity\n- High: You enjoy teaming up with other people, chatting, and playing in groups. You might group with friends or collaborate with strangers. You may enjoy *Destiny* or *Final Fantasy XIV*.\n- Low: You prefer having full control of your experience and playing in single-player mode. \n\n### Tall Cluster: Mastery and Achievement\n\nThe **tall** cluster, or mastery-achievement cluster, is about long-term satisfaction. A player with high motivations in the tall cluster wants to see things grow over time, to make plans and watch them come to fruition, to keep a cool head as they complete or master a game. A player with low motivations in this cluster might not want to \"wait for the good part\" or prefer to have more immediate control over their experience.\n\nChallenge\n- High: You enjoy games that test your skills, even if they have a steep learning curve. You feel satisfied when you clear a difficult mission or pull off a difficult move. You find the idea of getting better over time to be a powerful motivator. You might enjoy *Street Fighter* or *osu!*\n- Low: You like games that are quick to learn and no sweat to play. You might enjoy *The Longest Journey* or *Stardew Valley*.\n\nStrategy\n- High: You like to contemplate the outcome of your decisions. You enjoy it when games urge you to think and plan out a long-term strategy. You might enjoy *Crusader Kings* or *Stellaris*.\n- Low: You like to act spontaneously and react to your immediate surroundings. You find complex decisions in a game stressful or pointless. You prefer games you can pick up and play for a short time. You might enjoy *Mario Kart* or *The Sims*.\n\nPower\n- High: You like it most when the power of your character grows while you play. You like leveling up characters and stats, upgrading your weapons/powers, and dwarfing the same obstacles that were once an impossible challenge. You might enjoy *Diablo* or *World of Warcraft*.\n- Low: You like it when characters have a fully-developed set of powers from the start. You prefer a level playing field. You might enjoy *Shadow of the Colossus* or *Night in the Woods*.\n\nCompletion\n- High: You prefer to have clear tasks to complete and consistent rewards to collect for completing them. You like it when a game guides you to its next fun activity. You might enjoy *Kingdom Hearts* or *Lego Star Wars*.\n- Low: You prefer to decide what to do for yourself. You like it when a game gives you a sandbox of many possibilities and allows you to pursue your own goals. You might enjoy *Cities: Skylines* or *RimWorld*.\n\n### Wide Cluster: Immersion and Creativity\n\nThe **wide** cluster, or immersion-creativity cluster, is about expressive play. A player who scores high here wants to explore a world, to test the boundaries of the game, to get involved in a story, to express themselves. A low score here means the player prefers things that are concrete, compact, and elegant.\n\nFantasy\n- High: You love it when games have rich lore and an immersive setting. You prefer a photorealistic look or cinematic style. You might enjoy *Mass Effect* or *Fallout*.\n- Low: You find games with retro graphics or abstract settings charming. You don't need any world-building beyond the general vibe of a genre. You might enjoy *World of Tanks*, *Counter-Strike*, or *Marvel vs. Capcom*.\n\nStory\n- High: You like games that have an elaborate narrative structure, with a large cast of characters, each having distinct motivations and personality. You might enjoy *Mass Effect* or *Life is Strange*.\n- Low: You like games without any story getting in the way of the fun. These games might create a simple canvas with stock characters for you to build on. You might enjoy *SimCity*, *Factorio*, or *Minecraft*. \n\nDiscovery\n- High: You like to explore a world to find its secrets and treasure. When you find new objects or characters to interact with, you like to experiment to see how they react to the things you can do. You might enjoy the *Zelda* series or *The Elder Scrolls*.\n- Low: You approach games with a practical mindset. You prefer games you can fully understand with minimal unknown interactions. You might enjoy sports games like *FIFA* or board games like *Carcassonne*.\n\nDesign\n- High: You like to express yourself in the games you play. You enjoy customizing your character's clothes and arranging the decorations in your house. You might enjoy *The Sims*, *Animal Crossing*, or *Guild Wars 2*.\n- Low: You prefer an experience curated by a designer. You enjoy inhabiting a fixed avatar of some stylish or appealing character. You might enjoy *Super Mario Galaxy* or *Horizon Zero Dawn*.\n\n### Applying These\n\nThis gamer motivation model is one way to understand the different reasons various people play video games. You can incorporate it into your vocabulary when explaining or evaluating a game design. You might use it to broaden the game's appeal or focus on the things you expect your players to care about.\n\nIts main limitation is that it is very generalized. It has limited power to describe an individual person's habits (which might apparently contradict themselves) or preferences in the community of a particular game. The number of segments is also arbitrary; there might be applications where more divisions or fewer prove more useful.\n\nFor a more \"pick one\" classification, if you want a drop-in replacement for Bartle types, you might look at the [[Ten Player Profiles]].\n\n\n# Further Reading\n\nMarc LeBlanc's website, discussing the 8 Kinds of Fun and other game design ideas. [http://algorithmancy.8kindsoffun.com/](http://algorithmancy.8kindsoffun.com/ \"http://algorithmancy.8kindsoffun.com/\")\n\nRobin Hunicke and Rubert Zubek wrote an academic paper based on LeBlanc's 8 kinds of fun and the Mechanics/Dynamics/Aesthetics framework. [http://www.cs.northwestern.edu/~hunicke/MDA.pdf](http://www.cs.northwestern.edu/~hunicke/MDA.pdf \"http://www.cs.northwestern.edu/~hunicke/MDA.pdf\")\n\nPresentation summarizing Quantic Foundry's gamer motivation model. \nhttps://quanticfoundry.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Gamer-Motivation-Model-Reference.pdf\n\nAcademic paper describing the same. https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2967934.2967937\n","lastmodified":"2023-04-17T21:32:41.594932417Z","tags":["clean","primer","game-design"]},"/TTRPG-Gaming":{"title":"TTRPG Gaming","content":"\nThese are the notes I've collected about tabletop role-playing games.

The discussion may include acting, improvised storytelling, or a processes of structured decision-making. Most often, actions taken by characters within the game succeed or fail according to a formal system of rules and guidelines.\n\nPlay of an RPG typically works like this:\n- A group of people gather for the purpose of playing a particular tabletop RPG.\n- Players determine their roles and create characters as necessary, discussing it along the way.\n\t- Usually, one player takes the role of \"GM\"; the game master, guide, moderator, referee or storyteller. In *Dungeons \u0026 Dragons*, this role is called dungeon master.\n\t- The other players typically have one \"player character\" each.\n- Everybody takes some time to get familiar with the rules necessary to start playing.\n- The GM describes a situation that the player characters are involved in. She asks the players what they want to do.\n- The players describe what the characters say or do in the fiction.  The GM listens: if no game rules apply to this situation, they describe how the situation changes, with an aim towards bringing the players into an exciting or dangerous situation. Otherwise, the GM interprets and applies the rules.\n\t- The GM will usually explain what rules are being applied, so that everything seems fair to the players.\n- The game may switch to procedures for a different mode, like a contest between two characters, a battle, a chase scene, an investigation, or a debate. These are outlined in a game's rules.\n- Players continue as long as they like. Usually this is 2-3 hours, stopping at any natural stopping point or the end of prepared material.\n\nFor a video game metaphor, think Zork, or other interactive fiction. You have a situation described with words and use words to explain what you want to do.\n\nIf you would like to know more about the origin of RPGs, it's covered in the [[History of Games]].\n\n## Why would you play one of these when video games exist?\n\nWell, they're something different, and that can be enough. But I think it's important to realize that a tabletop RPG creates quite a different experience than a video game, even if the game is a *Baldur's Gate* or *Solasta: Crown of the Magister* that aims to implement the rules text of a particular tabletop game as closely as it can.\n\n- Because the text and the play of tabletop RPGs are built out of language, and interpreted in whatever way the people at the table agree to, there are way more possibilities for **creative play**. Even in the crunchiest combat-focused games, players will be improvising actions, combining powers in novel ways, or interpreting the consequences of the fight beyond simple scorekeeping.\n- In a video game, you're following a path written by someone else. In a tabletop game, you can **tell the story as you want it**, really inhabit the character you're playing, and leave your own mark on the world.\n- Tabletop RPGs **aren't code, they're ideas**. You can tweak the game you're playing to match what you want it to do without being a professional artist or software engineer. They're run by a group of living, breathing human beings, so it's relatively easy to fix problems and oversights in your games yourself.\n- RPGs have a **thriving independent scene** these days thanks to Internet communities, digital publishing, print-on-demand services, and the ease of tweaking and remixing ideas from other games.\n- Tabletop games are often **easier to learn** and understand than video games, especially to people who aren't frequent gamers. You never have to figure out a confusing user interface or figure out the sequence of buttons that lets you do what you want. You don't need to worry about reflexes or hand-eye coordination. A capable GM can allow players of all abilities to have a fun time together.\n- RPGs are **cooperative, social, and collaborative** by nature. They're a structured way to have conversations with friends. Role-playing is a lot of fun, even when you're doing it badly.\n- If you're playing at a table, it's great to see people face-to-face. You can take a break from the screens that occupy so much else of your life. There's also something really pleasant about rolling dice, flipping through books, jotting down notes, marking things on character sheets, and making maps.\n\n# Further Reading\n\n[How to Get Into Tabletop RPGs! - Shut Up \u0026 Sit Down](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9NtdF51GWE) provides a humorous, encouraging entryway into the hobby.","lastmodified":"2023-04-17T21:32:41.594932417Z","tags":["ttrpg-gaming","primer","rough"]},"/TTRPGs-You-Can-Play-For-Free":{"title":"TTRPGs You Can Play For Free","content":"\nThis is a list of tabletop RPGs that you can download (or read online) and start playing for free.

They are:\n- The Acrobat\n- The Gardener\n- The Slayer\n- The Sightseer\n- The Gladiator\n- The Ninja\n- The Bounty Hunter\n- The Architect\n- The Bard\n\n(Tag yourself.)\n\n**The Acrobat** is a solo gamer who primarily wants to take on challenging gameplay, practicing over and over again until they can take on the most difficult missions and bosses. They enjoy games like *[[gamerecs/Spelunky|Spelunky]]*, *[[gamerecs/Celeste|Celeste]]*, *[[gamerecs/Super Metroid|Super Metroid]]*, and *[[gamerecs/Tetris|Tetris]]*.\n\n**The Gardener** is a gamer looking for quiet, relaxing task completion. They want games where the rules are presented upfront, as directly as possible, and the gameplay itself is spontaneous rather than planned out in advance. The vibes are chill and the beats are lo-fi. They enjoy games like *Candy Crush Saga*, Solitaire, and *Animal Crossing*.\n\n**The Slayer** is a gamer who wants curated cinematic destruction. They feel a rush from chaos and mayhem in the context of a rich game world with an overarching story. They typically enjoy on-rails action-adventure games like *Uncharted* and *Tomb Raider*.\n\n**The Sightseer** is a lot like the Slayer, but with a preference for less violence. Artisinal story experiences like *Firewatch*, *INSIDE*, or Telltale's *The Walking Dead* are favorites of the Sightseer. (This is my own distinction, not mentioned in the QF article.)\n\n**The Skirmisher** wants fast-paced, social action games they can easily pick up and play. They probably enjoy online shooters such as *Call of Duty* or *Counter-Strike*, but don't take the competitive aspects too seriously. They are fine with match-based games where everything resets each match.**\n\n**The Gladiator** is a self-described \"hardcore\" gamer who wants an experience that's truly epic. Their ideal game has a broad spectrum of features including: power progression, team arenas, fast-paced play, challenges that require strategic thinking, and a rich world with tons of lore. They often enjoy games like *Destiny*, *Gears of War*, *Monster Hunter*, or *Black Desert Online*.\n\n**The Ninja** is a gamer who wants to take on difficult challenges that also involve strategic decision making, fast-paced play, and competition. They don't care as much about in-game progression as they do skill-based mastery and their own accomplishments. They might play games like *StarCraft*, *Street Fighter*, *Super Smash Brothers*, *osu!*, or *League of Legends*.\n\n**The Bounty Hunter** wants an open game world that they can make their own. They want to explore stuff, build stuff, and power up their characters in the context of the world. Popular games for the Bounty Hunter include *Saints Row*, *Mass Effect*, *Far Cry*, *The Elder Scrolls*, and *Fallout*.\n\n**The Architect** wants planning and decision-making that leads to progression and task completion, often in a game with an interesting setting or story. Maybe you are putting together a functional craft economy on Mars, playing politics in a medieval monarchy, or figuring out just the right combination of abilities and party members to exorcise the wretched sea ghosts from the pirates' den. The Architect strongly prefers solo gameplay with games that are slow-paced, relaxing, or serene. They often play games like *Civilization*, *Europa Universalis*, *Banished*, or *Pillars of Eternity*.\n\n**The Bard** is a social gamer who wants to chat and interact with other players in game worlds that are rich with lore, stories, discovery, and customization. They care little about power progression and task completion. They just want to experience the game world organically. Their popular games include titles like *The Secret World*, *Final Fantasy XIV*, and *Animal Crossing*.\n\n(Games for the Bard are usually multiplayer, but games that have a big emphasis on sharing your own creations or participating in an online fandom are also appealing to the Bard.)\n\n## Limitations\n\n\u003e There isn't a one-size-fits-all player segment model that works for every situation.\n\nFirst, these are more like paint colors you can mix together than separate buckets. \n\nThis segment model provides a broad taxonomy for gamers as a whole, but they read like caricatures of genres--you lose nuance and granularity when you try to segment all gamers. If you're making an Open World Action-Adventure game then the largest block of players in your audience will be Bounty Hunters--but so what? You probably already knew that. You will need more data if you're working within a specific genre or a specific game title. They suggest working with just a sample of players who care about your genre or franchise.\n\n## Further Reading\n\nhttps://quanticfoundry.com/2020/08/17/player-segments/","lastmodified":"2023-04-17T21:32:41.594932417Z","tags":["rough","reference","learning","game-design"]},"/Timmy-Johnny-and-Spike":{"title":"Timmy, Johnny, and Spike","content":"\nMark Rosewater is an American game designer best known for being the head designer for the collectible card game *Magic: The Gathering*, a position he's held since 2003. He writes a column called \"Making Magic\" where he gives a behind-the-scenes look on how *Magic* cards are made. Around 2002, he wrote an article titled \"Timmy, Johnny, and Spike\", in which he explained three psychographic profiles that Wizards of the Coast uses when developing their products. If their goal is to make \"something for everybody\", then these are the \"everybodies\" they have in mind.\n\n(By the way, a psychographic profile is just a fancy term for saying \"let's apply statistics to our market research to put them into convenient groups.\")\n\nA **Timmy** (or **Tammy**) is a player who wants to play socially or \"for fun.\" They like to use cards with big, impressive effects. They aren't too worried about winning or losing. You can compare them to [Bartle](Bartle%20Taxonomy.md)'s Socializers.\n\nA **Johnny/Jenny** is a player who wants to build complex and creative decks as an exercise in self-expression. They want to use cards with unusual interactions or combos, or come up with ways to make \"useless\" cards work for them. They want to win, but only if they can win with style. You might compare these to Bartle's Explorers, or at least the aspect that wants to analyze and manipulate game mechanics.\n\nA **Spike** is a player motivated by the spirit of competition. They want to become a stronger player, prove how good they are, and outplay their opponents. They focus on trying to win by any means necessary (within the bounds of the game; Spikes aren't usually cheaters), even if it means relying on decks or strategies developed by others. The push for victory is what gives them the most mental stimulation. You can compare Spikes to Bartle's Killers.\n\nAs with all player classifications, individuals are too complex to fit completely into one of these boxes, but they can be helpful goalposts for design.\n\nWhere do Bartle's Diamonds fit in? Well, the nature of *Magic* is that you play a game for ten minutes to an hour, then everything resets. There's no way to accumulate points, complete quests, accrue new spells, and so on just from playing. This is a good example of how analyzing player types from looking at a single game might be misleading.\n\nOver the years, this trio has been extended with a separate \"aesthetic profile\" to describe what a player appreciates about *Magic* even when they aren't playing it. The first of these is **Mel**, a player who thinks cards with interesting rules interactions are beautiful, who might call things \"elegant\" or \"well-designed\" as a term of endearment. The second is **Vorthos** (first described by *Magic* artist Matt Cavotta), a player invested in the lore of the *Magic* world, someone who thinks a card with strong flavor and creative consistency is beautiful. These both roughly correspond to Bartle's Explorer type, but I think that comparison just reveals that we need a larger vocabulary to talk about this stuff.\n\nIt's good to be familiar with these terms Timmy/Tammy, Johnny/Jenny, and Spike because they often come up in discussions about multiplayer, competitive games. However, it's important to remember that they are also the product of one company's market research, rather than any peer-reviewed academic consensus, and the scope of their application may be as limited as \"why this person buys *Magic: The Gathering* products\".\n\n## Further Reading\n\n\nhttps://mtg.fandom.com/wiki/Player_type\n\nhttps://magic.wizards.com/en/news/making-magic/timmy-johnny-and-spike-2013-12-03\n\n\n\"against timmy, johnny, and spike\", one *Magic* player's perspective against the common classifications.

The political atmosphere in countries like the United States and the United Kingdom makes it tough for these people to feel like they have the support, the rights, and the medical care they need to thrive. I'm speaking up to spread awareness of how you can be a better ally to the transgender people in your life.\n\n## Easy Tips for Allies\n\n- Know that there is no one way to be a 'perfect' ally. Accept that you will sometimes make mistakes, but if you do your best, stay respectful, and are ready to listen, you'll stay on the right path.\n- You don't have to understand someone's identity to respect it. All people deserve respect.\n- You can't \"just know\" if someone is trans by looking at them or listening to the way they talk. There is no one way for transgender people to look. It's possible that there are trans people alongside you in line at the Subway, or watching movies with you at the theater. You might never know and that's *fine*.\n- Speak out in support of transgender people and transgender rights! Being an outspoken ally makes the social spaces you inhabit safer for trans people, even if you don't know of any trans people there. Politely correct others if they use the wrong name or pronoun for a transgender person.\n- There is no \"one right way\" to be transgender. Some trans people change their legal names, and some don't. Some change aspects of their appearance like clothing and hair, and some don't. Some people chose to medically transition, and some don't. It doesn't matter what things a trans person has or hasn't done to transition; a trans man is still a man, and a trans woman is still a woman.\n- Use the language a transgender person uses for themselves.\n- If you don't know what pronouns to use, just ask. If you still feel unsure, share your own pronouns first. \"Hi, I'm Komma, and I use he/him/his as my pronouns. How about you?\" Don't make a big deal out of a pronoun mistake; just apologize and move on.\n- Be careful and considerate about what other questions you ask. You should probably **avoid** these kinds of questions unless you are very close to the trans person:\n\t- What is your birth name? (And you should never call it their \"real\" name!)\n\t- Do you have photographs from before you transitioned?\n\t- What hormones are you taking?\n\t- What surgeries have you had?\n\t- ...or any question about sexual relationships.\n- Someone's transgender identity is *their* private information. Just because someone has told you about their identity does not necessarily mean they have told everyone in their life. Maybe they're worried about being mistreated by their family, or fired from their job, or simply not ready for the emotional labor of coming out to everyone. Err on the side of privacy.\n- Avoid compliments or adviced based on stereotypes about how men or women should look/act, or stereotypes about transgender people. These can be hurtful, even if they are said with good intentions. **Avoid** comments like the following:\n\t- \"You look like a real woman!\"\n\t- \"I never would have known that you're trans.\"\n\t- \"You would look less trans if you wore more makeup.\"\n\t- \"No real man would wear that jacket. You should change if you don't want people to know you're transgender.\"\n\t- \"I'd date him, even though he's transgender.\"\n- Think about how you use gendered language. Many transgender people are fine being called 'ladies' and 'gentlemen', but you can't know without first asking. There are a variety of ways you can change your habits and practice nongendered language. Some examples:\n\t- \"Hey folks\" instead of \"Hey guys\"\n\t- \"Esteemed guests\" or \"everyone\" instead of \"ladies and gentlemen\"\n\t- \"To whom it may concern\" instead of \"Dear sir or madam\"\n\t- \"Salesperson\" instead of \"salesman\"\n\t- \"Legislator\" instead of \"congressman\"\n\t- \"Performer\" instead of \"actor/actress\"\n\t- \"Toughen up\" instead of \"man up\"\n- On forms and documents, consider whether you need to include gender at all. How will that information be used? If you do need to ask for it, use a blank space for people to fill in as they feel comfortable, rather than boxes marked \"male\" and \"female\".\n- Push to allow people to use bathrooms and other facilities in a way that matches their gender identity rather than what's on their government-issued ID. In particular, a single-occupant restroom should have a sign that just says \"restroom\".\n- Seek out education yourself in addition to the conversations you have with the trans people in your life.\n\n## Further Reading\n\n[National Center for Transgender Equality](https://transequality.org/issues/resources/supporting-the-transgender-people-in-your-life-a-guide-to-being-a-good-ally)","lastmodified":"2023-04-17T21:32:41.594932417Z","tags":["rough"]}}
