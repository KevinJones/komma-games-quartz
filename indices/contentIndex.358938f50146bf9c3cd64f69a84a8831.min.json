This website is an open notebook; a digital garden of my research and thoughts on subjects like writing, history, nature, foreign languages, and games of all kinds. My goal is to build up a public body of knowledge that anybody can wander through.\n\n## Where to start?\n\n- [[About Me]]\n- The [#best](tags/best) posts\n- Learn about my [[Game Reviews and Recommendations]]\n- Check out my [[Projects]]\n- Enjoy gaming in a variety of formats: [[Video Gaming]], [[Board Gaming]], and [[TTRPG Gaming]] \n- [#essays](tags/essays) comprising significant thoughts\n- My gamedev/writing [[Worldbuilding]]\n- My [[Learning]] of various subjects\n- [[Programming]] and game development notes\n- My niche [[Furry]] content\n- Posts by status: [#rough](tags/rough), [#clean](tags/clean), or [#polished](tags/polished)\n- ...or pick a recently updated note from the list at the bottom of this page!\n\n## What you should expect\n\n**I might be wrong.** This notebook is an act of learning and creating in public. It may occassionally contain factual errors, misleading phrases, or omit critical context. Please don't hold this against me. We're all learners! I encourage you to refer to multiple sources about anything important.\n\nI am **explicitly inviting you to criticise my work.** Every page in here is a living document. You can reach me at any of the social media links included in the footer on each page. (Telegram works best.) I will do my best to act on feedback and correct my notes.

In line with this goal, I've adopted these tags:\n\n- *#rough* for early, rough ideas.\n- *#clean* for something cleaned up and clarified.\n- *#polished* for something reasonably complete, but that still gets occasional updates.\n\n**I will make fictional contexts clear** when I'm discussing a detail of a fictional property or my own worldbuilding. I do not want anybody to get confused between fiction and reality.\n\n**No filler text** generated by an AI language model or similar tool. I aim to be authentically human, acne and all.\n\n**I will try to reward feedback, but can't promise to agree or respond to all of it.** I ultimately run this website for my own benefit, so I will not beg for views or feedback. I will listen to feedback and correct things I get wrong as soon as I can.

I am a millennial born and raised in the southeast United States. (I don't always love it, but I don't have any plans to leave, either.) My educational background is in computer science (Georgia Tech, 2012) but my interests also include foreign languages, history, nature, writing, and games of every sort. What I want to do is bring ideas from my head into reality, to make the world a better place than it was when I found it, and to help the good people of the world treat each other with a little bit more calm and kindness.\n\nI am an asexual cisgender man (though somewhat of an androphile) and support all members of the LGBTQIA+ community. I wish to say in no uncertain terms that trans men are men, trans women are women, and [[Trans Rights Are Human Rights]], and additionally that Black lives matter. I have also been a member of the furry fandom for the better part of two decades, and for all its ups and downs it has been a constant source of friendship, inspiration, and challenging ideas in my life. My [[fursona]] is an anthropomorphic chameleon who gives very good hugs.\n\nI think something I value most is authenticity. I want to be mindful of my experiences in life, how my own acts and thoughts have shaped them, and the extent to which I allow myself to be shaped by them. I must be true to myself, truthful to others, and dishonest never. By being authentic, I can exercise kindness in everything I do, without getting stuck on some ulterior motivation. Along with this, I embrace creativity in artistic expression and problem solving. I process information critically and keep my mind open to other possibilities. While it can be exhausting, I love to learn, and I am eager to understand what new kinds of beauty exist in the world.\n\nIn terms of technical skills, my favorite [programming](#programming) languages are C#, TypeScript, and Python. The toolbox also includes JavaScript, C, C++, Java, Lua, and a touch of Rust, Kotlin, and Objective-C. (I prefer TypeScript over JavaScript and Kotlin over Java whenever possible.) I have worked on games in Godot, Unity, Cocos2D-X, and CreateJS, and deployed them to platforms including the iOS App Store and the mobile web, with game prototypes playable on all major desktop operating systems. I have some exposure to emscripten. Markdown is my preferred syntax for blogging and note-taking, typically alongside Joplin (my old fave) or Obsidian (my new fave), although I am comfortable with HTML, CSS, and JSON blobs as well. I am a confident writer and my peers have often complimented my project organization skills. Other people trust me for my technical advice.\n\nIt is no secret that [I am a fan of video games](Game Recommendations). I grew up playing the likes of *Commander Keen* and *Lemmings* alongside classic entries in the Nintendo catalog, and continue to keep up with the industry's biggest surprises and independent hits. I also adore the design sense of modern board games like *Root* and *Race for the Galaxy*, and have a harmless obsession with reading through tabletop RPG books and daydreaming about all the possible adventures they promise. (Alas, few are able to slay that dread beast, Scheduling.) With the advent of streaming video, my interest in Japanese video games bloomed into an appreciation for all kinds of international media. I count *The Diving Bell and the Butterfly* and *Portrait of a Lady on Fire* among my favorite films alongside *Princess Mononoke* and just-plain-fun series like *Death Note*.","lastmodified":"2023-02-23T21:07:00.344223368Z","tags":null},"/RPG-Primer":{"title":"RPG Primer","content":"\nA role-playing game, or **RPG**, is a game in which players discuss a fictional setting and assume the roles of characters within that setting. The discussion may include acting, improvised storytelling, or a processes of structured decision-making. Most often, actions taken by characters within the game succeed or fail according to a formal system of rules and guidelines.\n\nPlay of an RPG typically works like this:\n- A group of people gather for the purpose of playing a particular tabletop RPG.\n- Players determine their roles and create characters as necessary, discussing it along the way.\n\t- Usually, one player takes the role of \"GM\"; the game master, guide, moderator, referee or storyteller. In *Dungeons \u0026 Dragons*, this role is called dungeon master.\n\t- The other players typically have one \"player character\" each.\n- Everybody takes some time to get familiar with the rules necessary to start playing.\n- The GM describes a situation that the player characters are involved in. She asks the players what they want to do.\n- The players describe what the characters say or do in the fiction.  The GM listens: if no game rules apply to this situation, they describe how the situation changes, with an aim towards bringing the players into an exciting or dangerous situation. Otherwise, the GM interprets and applies the rules.\n\t- The GM will usually explain what rules are being applied, so that everything seems fair to the players.\n- The game may switch to procedures for a different mode, like a contest between two characters, a battle, a chase scene, an investigation, or a debate. These are outlined in a game's rules.\n- Players continue as long as they like. Usually this is 2-3 hours, stopping at any natural stopping point or the end of prepared material.\n\nFor a video game metaphor, think Zork, or other interactive fiction. You have a situation described with words and use words to explain what you want to do.\n\nIf you would like to know more about the origin of RPGs, it's covered in the [[History of Games]].\n\n## Why would you play one of these when video games exist?\n\nWell, they're something different, and that can be enough. But I think it's important to realize that a tabletop RPG creates quite a different experience than a video game, even if the game is a *Baldur's Gate* or *Solasta: Crown of the Magister* that aims to implement the rules text of a particular tabletop game as closely as it can.\n\n- Because the text and the play of tabletop RPGs are built out of language, and interpreted in whatever way the people at the table agree to, there are way more possibilities for **creative play**. Even in the crunchiest combat-focused games, players will be improvising actions, combining powers in novel ways, or interpreting the consequences of the fight beyond simple scorekeeping.\n- In a video game, you're following a path written by someone else. In a tabletop game, you can **tell the story as you want it**, really inhabit the character you're playing, and leave your own mark on the world.\n- Tabletop RPGs **aren't code, they're ideas**. You can tweak the game you're playing to match what you want it to do without being a professional artist or software engineer. They're run by a group of living, breathing human beings, so it's relatively easy to fix problems and oversights in your games yourself.\n- RPGs have a **thriving independent scene** these days thanks to Internet communities, digital publishing, print-on-demand services, and the ease of tweaking and remixing ideas from other games.\n- Tabletop games are often **easier to learn** and understand than video games, especially to people who aren't frequent gamers. You never have to figure out a confusing user interface or figure out the sequence of buttons that lets you do what you want. You don't need to worry about reflexes or hand-eye coordination. A capable GM can allow players of all abilities to have a fun time together.\n- RPGs are **cooperative, social, and collaborative** by nature. They're a structured way to have conversations with friends. Role-playing is a lot of fun, even when you're doing it badly.\n- If you're playing at a table, it's great to see people face-to-face. You can take a break from the screens that occupy so much else of your life. There's also something really pleasant about rolling dice, flipping through books, jotting down notes, marking things on character sheets, and making maps.\n\n# Further Reading\n\n[How to Get Into Tabletop RPGs! - Shut Up \u0026 Sit Down](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9NtdF51GWE) provides a humorous, encouraging entryway into the hobby.","lastmodified":"2023-02-23T21:07:00.344223368Z","tags":null},"/TTRPG-Gaming":{"title":"TTRPG Gaming","content":"\nThese are the notes I've collected about tabletop role-playing games.

The political atmosphere in countries like the United States and the United Kingdom makes it tough for these people to feel like they have the support, the rights, and the medical care they need to thrive. I'm speaking up to spread awareness of how you can be a better ally to the transgender people in your life.\n\n## Easy Tips for Allies\n\n- Know that there is no one way to be a 'perfect' ally. Accept that you will sometimes make mistakes, but if you do your best, stay respectful, and are ready to listen, you'll stay on the right path.\n- You don't have to understand someone's identity to respect it. All people deserve respect.\n- You can't \"just know\" if someone is trans by looking at them or listening to the way they talk. There is no one way for transgender people to look. It's possible that there are trans people alongside you in line at the Subway, or watching movies with you at the theater. You might never know and that's *fine*.\n- Speak out in support of transgender people and transgender rights! Being an outspoken ally makes the social spaces you inhabit safer for trans people, even if you don't know of any trans people there. Politely correct others if they use the wrong name or pronoun for a transgender person.\n- There is no \"one right way\" to be transgender. Some trans people change their legal names, and some don't. Some change aspects of their appearance like clothing and hair, and some don't. Some people chose to medically transition, and some don't. It doesn't matter what things a trans person has or hasn't done to transition; a trans man is still a man, and a trans woman is still a woman.\n- Use the language a transgender person uses for themselves.\n- If you don't know what pronouns to use, just ask. If you still feel unsure, share your own pronouns first. \"Hi, I'm Komma, and I use he/him/his as my pronouns. How about you?\" Don't make a big deal out of a pronoun mistake; just apologize and move on.\n- Be careful and considerate about what other questions you ask. You should probably **avoid** these kinds of questions unless you are very close to the trans person:\n\t- What is your birth name? (And you should never call it their \"real\" name!)\n\t- Do you have photographs from before you transitioned?\n\t- What hormones are you taking?\n\t- What surgeries have you had?\n\t- ...or any question about sexual relationships.\n- Someone's transgender identity is *their* private information. Just because someone has told you about their identity does not necessarily mean they have told everyone in their life. Maybe they're worried about being mistreated by their family, or fired from their job, or simply not ready for the emotional labor of coming out to everyone. Err on the side of privacy.\n- Avoid compliments or adviced based on stereotypes about how men or women should look/act, or stereotypes about transgender people. These can be hurtful, even if they are said with good intentions. **Avoid** comments like the following:\n\t- \"You look like a real woman!\"\n\t- \"I never would have known that you're trans.\"\n\t- \"You would look less trans if you wore more makeup.\"\n\t- \"No real man would wear that jacket. You should change if you don't want people to know you're transgender.\"\n\t- \"I'd date him, even though he's transgender.\"\n- Think about how you use gendered language. Many transgender people are fine being called 'ladies' and 'gentlemen', but you can't know without first asking. There are a variety of ways you can change your habits and practice nongendered language. Some examples:\n\t- \"Hey folks\" instead of \"Hey guys\"\n\t- \"Esteemed guests\" or \"everyone\" instead of \"ladies and gentlemen\"\n\t- \"To whom it may concern\" instead of \"Dear sir or madam\"\n\t- \"Salesperson\" instead of \"salesman\"\n\t- \"Legislator\" instead of \"congressman\"\n\t- \"Performer\" instead of \"actor/actress\"\n\t- \"Toughen up\" instead of \"man up\"\n- On forms and documents, consider whether you need to include gender at all. How will that information be used? If you do need to ask for it, use a blank space for people to fill in as they feel comfortable, rather than boxes marked \"male\" and \"female\".\n- Push to allow people to use bathrooms and other facilities in a way that matches their gender identity rather than what's on their government-issued ID. In particular, a single-occupant restroom should have a sign that just says \"restroom\".\n- Seek out education yourself in addition to the conversations you have with the trans people in your life.\n\n## Further Reading\n\n[National Center for Transgender Equality](https://transequality.org/issues/resources/supporting-the-transgender-people-in-your-life-a-guide-to-being-a-good-ally)","lastmodified":"2023-02-23T21:07:00.348223426Z","tags":null}}
