Fun. Fun for everyone! -Satoru Iwata</p></blockquote><p>Suppose you&rsquo;re a game designer. You have made it your objective to create a game and make it fun. Perhaps you&rsquo;ve taken inspiration from the late Nintendo president Satoru Iwata. Maybe it&rsquo;s because you&rsquo;re a working professional, and you believe that a game that&rsquo;s more fun will sell better. (It certainly has to be &ldquo;fun enough&rdquo;!) Or maybe you&rsquo;re an artist, or a hobbyist with a loftier goal: doing what you can to make the human experience a little bit better by creating that elusive feeling of fun. There&rsquo;s just one problem.</p><p>What is &ldquo;fun&rdquo;?</p><p>One way to answer the question is to be as literal as possible. Fun entails a physiological response. It is a perception of novelty that stimulates the brain into releasing a communication chemical (or <em>neurotransmitter</em>) called dopamine. The dopamine stimulates the amygdala, a cluster of the brain that processes memory and emotions. Fun is something that tells your brain to create a pleasant feeling, and associate that feeling with the memory of the fun activity.</p><p>To the creator of art, this is somewhat helpful to know. There are a million ways to stimulate the brain, and fun could be a part of any one of them. If we think about the word &ldquo;fun&rdquo; itself, it describes something pleasant, personal, yet unpredictable. If you repeat something fun too often, it stops being fun; watch your favorite movie three times in a row to see how. A strong focus on goals and external rewards can turn a fun activity into a job. It is the nature of fun to defy easy definition.</p><p>I propose this: let&rsquo;s flip the question on its head. Instead of saying &ldquo;People want games that are fun. What is fun?&rdquo; let&rsquo;s say &ldquo;Fun is the thing the players want. What do they want?&rdquo; Why does a person play games? What motivates them to come back to the hobby, time and again? There are a couple older models worth mentioning, like the <a href=/Bartle-Taxonomy rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/Bartle-Taxonomy>Bartle Taxonomy</a> and &ldquo;<a href=/Timmy-Johnny-and-Spike rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/Timmy-Johnny-and-Spike>Timmy, Johnny, and Spike</a>,&rdquo; but I want to focus on Marc LeBlanc&rsquo;s &ldquo;Eight Kinds of Fun&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Gamer Motivation Model&rdquo; developed by the market research company Quantic Foundry.</p><a href=#eight-kinds-of-fun><h2 id=eight-kinds-of-fun><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Eight Kinds of Fun</h2></a><p>Game designer and educator Marc LeBlanc proposed the following non-exhaustive list to explain the different kinds of fun.</p><ol><li>Sensation: sense-pleasure</li><li>Fantasy: make-believe</li><li>Narrative: story</li><li>Challenge: obstacle course</li><li>Fellowship: social framework</li><li>Discovery: uncharted territory</li><li>Expression: self-discovery</li><li>Submission: pastime</li></ol><p>You can see these explained in context in
<a href=http://www.cs.northwestern.edu/~hunicke/pubs/MDA.pdf rel=noopener>Hunickle, LeBlanc, Zubek (2004)</a>. This paper explains something called the <em>MDA framework</em>, a formal way of looking at how people take in game artifacts. In simplest terms, a designer implements Mechanics (rules) that interact to create Dynamics (a system) that evoke in the player certain Aesthetics (desirable emotional responses, &ldquo;fun&rdquo;).</p><p>(This use of the word &ldquo;aesthetics&rdquo; is different from its common use, where it refers to something&rsquo;s visual style.)</p><p>To a game designer, <strong>fun is a desirable emotional response; any feeling that motivates play.</strong> It could be one of these eight kinds, or something totally different. It might even include some negative emotion to accentuate a positive, like fear leading to excitement, frustration leading to satisfaction, or sadness leading to catharsis.</p><p>Let&rsquo;s break each of these down further.</p><ol><li><strong>Sensation</strong>. The game as sense-pleasure. The game is a joy to touch. It is so pretty to look at and pleasant to listen to that a player can&rsquo;t help but smile.</li><li><strong>Fantasy</strong>. The game as make-believe. This means you&rsquo;re able to play a role you&rsquo;re not able to in real life, like a dragon-slaying heroine, a fast-driving outlaw, or the mayor of a village of animals.</li><li><strong>Narrative</strong>. The game as an unfolding story. This might be drama you witness, where your game interactions connect you with the world and characters. Or, it might be a plotline that changes depending on your play.</li><li><strong>Challenge</strong>. The game as an obstacle course. This kind of fun is the satisfaction you get from overcoming an arbitrary hurdle. Note that this isn&rsquo;t synonymous with difficulty. A designer doesn&rsquo;t always need to give players failure to challenge them.</li><li><strong>Fellowship</strong>. The game as a social framework. As designers, we can express this as <em>Cooperation</em> or <em>Competition</em>. In cooperative fellowship, players work together as a group to achieve a goal in the game. In competitive fellowship, players agree to compete, so they may pursue the pleasure of besting another real human being. Fellowship might also mean chatting and interacting with other people through an avatar.</li><li><strong>Discovery</strong>. The game as uncharted territory. It&rsquo;s fun to see new things, explore new places, and analyze the intricacies of a game system.</li><li><strong>Expression</strong>. These are games that let you express some aspect of yourself. You might build structures, design outfits, act out a character&rsquo;s personality, or execute a plan of your own invention.</li><li><strong>Submission</strong>. The game as a mindless pastime. This word might sound scary, like you&rsquo;re surrendering your free will to a machine. It shouldn&rsquo;t! In the human experience, it can be very helpful to have something to help pass the time while your mind focuses elsewhere. Some people will enjoy a phone puzzle to pass fifteen minutes while waiting for the bus. At other times, people crave a massive adventure where they can spend hours completing tasks when they are too tired to do anything else.</li></ol><p>I personally find that a game can be best described as focusing on two to four kinds of fun. This doesn&rsquo;t mean they are absent of the other kinds of fun; just that they aren&rsquo;t the focus. Also remember that this taxonomy is non-exhaustive. There might be other kinds of fun&ndash;other desirable emotional responses&ndash;that aren&rsquo;t covered by these eight. You might also consider ones that are more specific; you might distinguish between <em>narrative</em> filled with jokes and <em>narrative</em> filled with political intrigue.</p><p>Different kinds of fun may come at odds with each other during the design process. For example, increasing the costs of a player&rsquo;s powerful wizard spells might make the game a more satisfying Challenge. The same design choice will hurt the Fantasy of being a powerful magician. For a second example, lavish visuals and prominent music may add to a game&rsquo;s Sensation pleasures. Yet that change may reduce the clarity needed for competitors to find Fellowship. You should try to understand which kinds of fun your experience keeps in focus in order to weigh the trade-offs and make better design choices.</p><a href=#examples><h3 id=examples><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Examples</h3></a><p>To better understand fun, let&rsquo;s take a look at some popular video games and board games and ask what aesthetics they appeal to.</p><ul><li><em>Super Mario Brothers</em> is about:<ul><li>the Challenge of helping Mario run and jump safely from the start of one level to the next,</li><li>the Sensation of his expertly-tuned physics and chipper sound effects, and</li><li>the Discovery of the tricks and secrets hidden in every level.</li></ul></li><li><em>Tetris Effect</em> appeals to Sensation with its interactive music and spectacular backgrounds. It appeals to Submission with its simple rules, variety of difficulty levels, and endless challenge modes.</li><li><em>Red Dead Redemption 2</em> appeals to:<ul><li>the Fantasy of being a cowboy outlaw,</li><li>the Discovery of the landmarks and sights of the wild west, and</li><li>the Narrative of Arthur Morgan&rsquo;s dramatic quest for survival.</li></ul></li><li><em>Earthbound</em> has:<ul><li>a strange, sentimental Narrative about psychic kids trying to stop a covert invasion of space aliens, with</li><li>the Sensation of its poppy sample-based soundtrack and</li><li>the Discovery of its distinct towns, funny enemies, and exotic destinations.</li></ul></li><li><em>Pandemic</em> is a board game where a Fellowship of friends cooperate to win or lose. They engage with the Fantasy of being a team of medical experts tasked with eradicating a global pandemic. Players must overcome the game&rsquo;s considerable strategic Challenge by thinking together.</li><li>Key to <em>Magic the Gathering</em> is the Discovery of countless card combinations that players can build into personalized decks. A player might try to make their deck strong or fill it with amusing shenanigans. Some players seek the game&rsquo;s Competitive Fellowship, honing their tactics and deck construction. Others see their decks as an opportunity for self-Expression by picking the mana colors and card themes they enjoy the most.</li><li><em>Minecraft</em> is an open-ended sandbox often played for Fellowship in a tight community of players. Each player may choose a different goal, depending on what they find fun. Some may seek Expression by gathering the materials needed to build elaborate homes. Some may try to Discover the world&rsquo;s natural wonders, villages, or underground resource deposits. Others might enjoy hanging out.</li><li>The <em>Diablo</em> games are action RPGs ideal for Submission. Treasure is plentiful. Character upgrades are frequent but not always predictable. Objectives, usually wiping a bunch of demons and undead, are clear and satisfying. Diablo&rsquo;s cooperative play supports Fellowship. Its elite monsters and unlockable difficulty levels create Challenge. The variety of playable character archetypes help players fulfill the Fantasy; each can be their favorite kind of gothic hero.</li></ul><p>Try analyzing one of your favorite games using these ideas. What kinds of fun does it favor? How might you change the game if you wanted to emphasize a different kind of fun? Using <em>Super Mario Brothers</em> as an example, you could make it a better tool of Expression by including a level editor and allowing players to share their creations with others, and allowing players to unlock more building blocks for their own levels by clearing associated challenges in the game&rsquo;s platforming mode. A team of designers did exactly this when creating <em>Mario Maker</em>.</p><a href=#quantic-foundry-gamer-motivation-model-from-yee-and-ducheneaut><h2 id=quantic-foundry-gamer-motivation-model-from-yee-and-ducheneaut><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Quantic Foundry gamer motivation model from Yee and Ducheneaut</h2></a><p>Quantic Foundry is a video game analytics/marketing research firm. They used data science and a massive amount of survey data (collected from the
<a href=https://apps.quanticfoundry.com/surveys/start/gamerprofile/ rel=noopener>gamer motivation profile</a> survey, which you can take for free online) to create the &ldquo;Gamer Motivation Model&rdquo;; an attempt to describe why people play games and the different preferences of those gamers. This model was developed by the company&rsquo;s co-founders, Nick Yee and Nicolas Ducheneaut, both scientists with academic backgrounds. If you want to know more about their methods, this
<a href=https://quanticfoundry.com/2016/04/07/gdc-talk/ rel=noopener>2016 GDC Talk</a> might be illuminating, but if you just want the bottom line, keep reading.</p><p>This taxonomy breaks down into twelve motivation factors, grouped into six pairs within three clusters. They are:</p><ul><li>&ldquo;Bright&rdquo; cluster - immediate fun<ul><li><strong>Action:</strong> Destruction and Excitement</li><li><strong>Social:</strong> Competition and Community</li></ul></li><li>&ldquo;Tall&rdquo; cluster - cool-headed, long-term fun<ul><li><strong>Mastery:</strong> Challenge and Strategy</li><li><strong>Achievement:</strong> Completion and Power</li></ul></li><li>&ldquo;Wide&rdquo; cluster - broad, curious, expressive play<ul><li><strong>Immersion:</strong> Fantasy and Story</li><li><strong>Creativity:</strong> Design and Discovery</li></ul></li></ul><p>These factors are spectrums. If a person has a low score in one, that doesn&rsquo;t mean indifference, it means a strong preference for the opposite. If you have a high score for Community, it means you prefer to group up and collaborate with other players. If you have a low score, it means you prefer single-player play where you are in full control.</p><p>Let&rsquo;s try to break these down.</p><a href=#bright-cluster-action-and-socialization><h3 id=bright-cluster-action-and-socialization><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Bright Cluster: Action and Socialization</h3></a><p>The <strong>bright</strong> cluster, or action-social cluster, is about short-term gratification. A player who scores high on these motivations craves excitement, either from interacting with other players or the game itself.

You can incorporate it into your vocabulary when explaining or evaluating a game design. You might use it to broaden the game&rsquo;s appeal or focus on the things you expect your players to care about.</p><p>Its main limitation is that it is very generalized. It has limited power to describe an individual person&rsquo;s habits (which might apparently contradict themselves) or preferences in the community of a particular game. The number of segments is also arbitrary; there might be applications where more divisions or fewer prove more useful.</p><p>For a more &ldquo;pick one&rdquo; classification, if you want a drop-in replacement for Bartle types, you might look at the <a href=/Ten-Player-Profiles rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/Ten-Player-Profiles>Ten Player Profiles</a>.</p><a href=#further-reading><h1 id=further-reading><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Further Reading</h1></a><p>Marc LeBlanc&rsquo;s website, discussing the 8 Kinds of Fun and other game design ideas.Â
